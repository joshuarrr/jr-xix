      <h1>Aila, The Winged Unicorn</h1>
      
      <hr />
      
      <p className="section-title">I: The Day</p>
      
      <p className="section-title">The Dream</p>
      
      <p>The young unicorn Aila was dozing in the meadow in the hour past dawn — in the hour before day — when she awoke with a jump. </p>
      
      <p>She had been dreaming of the wishing ceremony, and in her dream she had walked down the long aisles past the Minotaurs, and around the radiant blue pool where the beloved Siren sisters sang their beautiful harmonies, and then up to the great dais where Osiler the Great Stallion waited, and she stepped her manicured hooves into the divots in the stone that had worn there after eons of similar events, and she froze. </p>
      
      <p>She knew that she must sing, and she knew the song she must sing – she&rsquo;d been practicing it for the past two months day and night – but she could not utter a sound. She looked around at the patient elders who stood in a semi-circle behind the Great Stallion nervously. Elsie, her eldest sister was on the far left and she appeared annoyed. Beside her, Odon, her father, dark and grave, and the largest of the unicorns in the room apart from Osiler. Then came her older cousins, Liba and Pico, and her aunts, and her uncles, and well, everyone. And on her far right-hoof, her mother, Eranor, slender and tall, and purely white with stunning green eyes. Eranor nodded her onward when their eyes met, and that slight nudge broke Aila from her trepidatious trance. </p>
      
      <p>She briefly collected her thoughts and recalled the words that laid out her wish. Words that in the human&rsquo;s language would translate to falling in love with a handsome tall stallion and raising beautiful and kind foals. It was what nearly every young unicorn maiden had wished for, for several eons. But when she set herself and opened her mouth, her breath came out, but Aila found that she could not make a sound.</p>
      
      <p className="section-title">The Awakening</p>
      
      <p>She bolted upright which frightened Squalmy, her bunny friend who had been sleeping at her side for warmth, and he darted into the forest through the tall reeds. Three butterflies flitted up into the morning air, and one flitted right past her eyelashes and she flicked her tail harmlessly in mock annoyance.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Oh jee,&rdquo; she neighed aloud, Today <em>is</em> the wishing ceremony!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>She hopped a few times, kicking the leftover sleep out of her haunches, and sang out a long neigh, both to test out her voice and to express her joy to her friends in the meadow. The wishing ceremony was only the most important day in a young unicorn&rsquo;s life, and she&rsquo;d been waiting for it and dreaming about it for all of her 100 years. Well, to be fair she&rsquo;d only been aware of it for 99 1/2 years, so that would be a more accurate number if you&rsquo;re particular about such things. But as she bounded towards the endless golden fields of Naranthal where the elders would surely be gathered, something small troubled the young unicorn. She&rsquo;d never had a <em>bad</em> dream about the wishing ceremony. Why now, she wondered? </p>
      
      <p>Naranthal was still slumbering when she arrived, so she grazed a bit on the tall golden grass. Her head was full of the events to come later in the day. The namings, the blinding, the dream casting, and finally her wishing. She was especially excited about her cousin Liba&rsquo;s new foal who had just turned twenty and was to be given his name today. Aila had always called him Jialy, but many of the other unicorn&rsquo;s names for him were splendid as well. And she was excited for Tabor who was to be blinded for the year so that he could lead the herd to the best pastures - it was a special honor reserved for only the eldest and wisest. And of course Eranor would be casting dreams for them this year, as it was the fourth convergence of the three important equine planets, and that meant that she, Aila, would be in charge of caring for her dam when the ceremonies and festivities were over. Which meant that she would have to graze even more than usual today if her horn was to have enough energy to share! It was going to be a big day!</p>
      
      <p>She was bodiless in such thoughts when Fisko the fox came bounding out of the forest into the tall grass excitedly. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Oh! Aila, Aila! Come quick! Follow me! It&rsquo;s trouble!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;What is it, Fisko, what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; She asked. </p>
      
      <p>She didn&rsquo;t really mouth those words, though, because, as you know, horses and unicorns can&rsquo;t speak. We can only whinny, and neigh, and snort, and huff, and groan, and grunt, and sigh, and squeal, and sing, and bray, and roar... and okay, we can make a whole sweep of sounds, but you know what I mean. We certainly don&rsquo;t <em>talk</em>. No, instead, Aila just thought her thoughts, and <em>sent</em> them. But the effect was the same, so what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Landry and Squalmy! Hurry!&rdquo; The fox urged. </p>
      
      <p>Aila complied and followed Fisko into the woods full of her friends Cedar, and Oak, and Douglas, and Creek, and Slug, and Beetle, and Fern, and Bramble, and Ivy, and... I&rsquo;m doing it again, aren&rsquo;t I. I&rsquo;ll try to be more concise. She followed the fox into the woods, and though Fisko was fast, she was untroubled by keeping up. She was a unicorn and if she wanted she could run super, super, super fast. But she stayed behind Fisko to see what the trouble was.</p>
      
      <p>Landry was a bunny she had known for many summers, and when she saw his body flat on the ground and motionless, she whinnied in shock. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to him!?&rdquo; she exclaimed. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Well, him and Squalmy were hopping together, and each was trying to out-hop the other, and that&rsquo;s when I saw them and I laughed because they were about to hop themselves into the mud! And it&rsquo;s still funny, and if Landry wasn&rsquo;t fallen I&rsquo;d laugh again right now, because Squalmy did hop right into the mud, and when it was Landry&rsquo;s turn to hop next, he didn&rsquo;t! And so Squalmy hopped on out and thumped Landry in the ear and then Landry kicked Squalmy back and then they traded hops again but on each other&rsquo;s heads. And they were real upset with each other, too, and then they traded such very not nice words with each other, and then Squalmy hopped off towards the brook, and Landry tried to hop away too but when he jumped up into the air he just sort of froze, and then fell, and he&rsquo;s still here where he fell on the ground, right here...&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Oh Landry, you poor poor thing!&rdquo; Thought the unicorn. </p>
      
      <p>Aila bent her nose down to the ground, where her friend Landry lay motionless, and she nudged his furry body with her snout, and she was filled with such a tremendous sadness that a tear rose in her eye. And that tear rolled down her cheek, and it rolled off into the air beneath her cheek, and the tear had just decided to make its way in a direct path to the forest floor when it was pierced by one of the sharpest things in the world: a unicorn horn. </p>
      
      <p>The tear exploded into a colorful display. Purple, and pink. and red, and orange, and green, and teal, and blue, and a thousand other colors that only unicorns can see erupted from the spot where there was once a droplet of unicorn eye water. And it flashed out in a great cloud that disappeared almost instantly. But, when it was done, Aila&rsquo;s horn had retained some of the color, and it glowed warmly in the forest shade.</p>
      
      <p>What happened next both startled and amazed Fisko and the forest of friends surrounding Aila and the rabbit. She sharply thrust her horn into his side and picked him up a few inches off the ground. And his body stretched out and his eyes went wide. If you were watching closely you would have noticed the color moving from Aila&rsquo;s horn in a spiral down into Landry&rsquo;s body, and if you were watching really close you might have noticed that the color of his fur changed from brown to slightly <em>more</em> brown. If you were here to see it, that is. </p>
      
      <p>When she lifted her head, Aila looked down at her friend, who blinked his eyes three times in quick succession, and then scratched his right ear vigorously with his right foot. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Oh Aila! You saved poor Landry! I knew you could do it!! Hahaha!!!!&rdquo; And with that, Fisko the fox leapt over a log and out of sight. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Mister Landry,&rdquo; Aila looked down at the rabbit. &ldquo;You will make haste to apologize to my friend Mister Squalmy, now, won&rsquo;t you? I believe he owes you one as well. I believe both of your feelings were hurt today.&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am, absolutely I will. And thank you ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t know what happened, but I feel.. I feel great!! And Landry bounded off.</p>
      
      <p>Aila was left alone in the forest. And even if you were here you wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed this: the quiet unicorn closed her eyes and sighed and then she swallowed, and for a moment she felt as sad and empty as a unicorn could possibly feel, as though she had swallowed a tiny bite of death.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">The Morning</p>
      
      <p>The moment passed and she found her joy as she jumped over a muddy patch on her way back to the others. Aila loved to jump, and she did so merrily several times on her way. And she saw a lovely patch of dark green clover which she snacked on momentarily, which whet her appetite for a more substantial grazing. </p>
      
      <p>When she returned to the fields of Naranthal the other unicorns were mostly all still asleep, and that was fine by her. She had an empty belly to tend! And she grazed and grazed, and when she was full she ate some more because she knew she would need her energy later. </p>
      
      <p>Liba was the first to rise and when she saw Aila she made her way over and bowed customarily. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Gracious morning to you, young filly, how are you enjoying this day so far?&rdquo; Liba inquired.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Today has been grand. I am excited, of course, about the ceremonies. I restored Landry again, and that left me a bit cold, but I&rsquo;ve warmed myself on this delicious grass and my heart is full again. And you, Liba, are you happy today? Are you excited to find Jialy&rsquo;s true name?&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I am&rdquo;, Liba emoted, but she looked aside at the rolling hills. &ldquo;I am just nervous because Levnis feels strongly that the foal&rsquo;s name will be Ogok, and as you know I would much prefer Ansil. But of course it isn&rsquo;t up to me.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I am sure that Jialy will love his name no matter what it turns out to be!&rdquo;, Aila encouraged.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I am sure. But Ogok!?&rdquo; Liba scoffed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d cry&rdquo;.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Surely not, Liba! You will find joy in his name because it is his true sound. You only fear this name because you do not believe it is correct. But if it comes to be, you will know, and your love will cover this fear. You know this!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she replied &ldquo;but still, Ogok the Great!?&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I admit that it sounds... a bit silly.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And they both laughed, and they grazed, and Liba disturbed a sleeping Jay which she chased playfully for a bit, and Aila discovered a bit of golden clover, and thought to herself, &ldquo;What a wonderful day this is turning out to be!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>While she grazed, she thought longingly of her wish. She had of course been friends with the stallions of her herd for, well, for forever. But to truly love.. that must be the best feeling in the world, she thought. &rsquo;I bet it is magical. And my stallion will be the tallest in the heard, even taller than Odon or Osiler. He&rsquo;ll be all black, but with a hint of auburn that flashes in the sunlight, and he will be kind and powerful, and we will make a thousand foals.&rsquo; And her heart was aflutter, as she grazed and fantasized about her wish. </p>
      
      <p>But a distant reservation disturbed her reveries. Though it was unclear what, something pulled on her, nagged her, and her dreaming dissolved. And she paused and looked around at the field, and at the rolling hills, and her friend the bee buzzing by, and the forest, and the rousing heard of beautiful rising unicorns, and she took a deep breath, and she cantered off to make her preparations for the day.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">II: The Ceremony</p>
      
      <p className="section-title">The Namings</p>
      
      <p>There were to be four namings that day, and they came first so that the newest named could participate in the rest of the ceremonies. Names are very important to unicorns, for they serve to focus of all their magical energy. Without a name, a unicorn can run fast, but not super super super fast. And they can light their horns in a marvelous display, but they cannot channel that energy into acts of intention. They can bless, and they can send thoughts, but they cannot bless an individual creature, and they cannot project their thoughts as more than quiet hints. They can heal, but they cannot revive, and so for that reason, they are cared for and protected by the entire herd, and they are thought of as children without true individualism. But all of that changes with the passage of the naming ceremony.</p>
      
      <p>The foal whom Aila called Jialy was last to receive his name that day. Aila&rsquo;s names for the others were Morsha, Esper, and Thedlin. Morsha was a fine golden brown young mare, with a tremendously long blonde mane. Aila cared greatly for her as her dam was Aila&rsquo;s aunt Rostly. Aila loved all of her herd – it was her family after all – but she was especially friendly with Liba.</p>
      
      <p>Liba had a rebellious streak in her spirit that was matched by a jagged red stripe down her golden right flank. On several occasions, Aila had joined Liba on long walks far away from the herd, and they talked by opening and sharing their hearts and swirling their unformed thoughts together. Once they had even brazenly approached the gates to the other realms together, and though Aila was quite apprehensive about it, they put their noses through the distorted, swirling, images and peered into the world of The Men. They only peeked through for a moment, but what they saw confounded Aila and Liba both. For days Aila replayed disjointed scenes of Men and things that made little sense to her, but Liba was unbothered by such thoughts. Aila&rsquo;s curiosity festered, and one day she has brought it to Liba, but Liba said only that there was no need to worry themselves about the lives of Men, that they were trivial and simple, and perhaps she should have never taken Aila there. And they never did go back there together, but they did maintain a habit of going on long adventures making friends with all the beasts of their world. And thought Liba never went back to the gates, Aila one day would.</p>
      
      <p>At sundown, Morsha and the three others to be named approached the curved trees that marked the entrance to the Minotaur&rsquo;s maze with the rest of the heard at their backs. Their bodies together were striking in the waning light. Morsha was bright gold; Esper wore dappled blue; Thedlin was in white with auburn forelegs, tail, and mane; and of course Jialy was wearing his shaggy dark brown coat. In the waning light of the sun and the tinge of light from the moons, their four hides each had a distinct glow about them, while in collective they simply shone. </p>
      
      <p>From the shadows of the two great curved trees at the edge of the forest emerged Osiler. Without delay he approached the four foals and when only several feet away, he rose up on his hind legs and stomped forcibly down with his front hooves. There was a great thunderous sound, and a cloud of mist arose at his feet that rose upward revealing a fresh spring of pure crystalline water. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;First.&rdquo; He boomed. And he looked down to Morsha. Because he was the Great Stallion he did not have a name for her. </p>
      
      <p>Nervous but excited, Morsha stepped forward into the pool. It glowed gently where her hooves touched, but she only sank in a few inches. She took two more small steps towards the Great Stallion and looked shyly up at him.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; Osiler cried. </p>
      
      <p>The rest of the heard, about 27 unicorns in total, were gathered behind the namelings in a wide arc. The first to call out was Morsha&rsquo;s dam, Rostly. She stepped forward, and responded, &ldquo;Tinip!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And from the horn of the unicorn standing in the pool came a strong but gentle blue light. And Rostly stepped back.</p>
      
      <p>Her sire, Trally, stepped forth. &ldquo;Ioni!&rdquo; He cried.</p>
      
      <p>And the horn of the unicorn emitted a soft orange glow.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Kalee!&rdquo; Cried Liba. And the horn glowed somewhat brighter orange.</p>
      
      <p>Aila stepped forward to take her turn. &ldquo;Morsha!&rdquo; She cried. And the horn glowed a wonderful bright pink. It was the brightest yet, and she stepped back to her place hopefully.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Kelve!&rdquo; Cried Pico, the young mare&rsquo;s uncle. The horn shone a pale green, and dimmed considerably.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Tessa!&rdquo; Cried another. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Sendry!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Eva!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Leston!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Shai!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And after a long silence, and after the light from her horn had faded, she looked up at Osiler with a newfound poise and replied, &ldquo;My name is Morsha.&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>And with that, the horn on every unicorn there in the fledgling darkness by the forest cast a marvelous explosion of bright pink light, and Morsha&rsquo;s horn was brightest of all. </p>
      
      <p>When the pink light dimmed, Osiler bowed his head, and Morsha trotted back to join the row of unicorns behind her.</p>
      
      <p>Breglin and Thorsh&rsquo;s names were chosen in a similar fashion, and while Aila&rsquo;s name Esper made a strong showing, she was joyed to learn Breglin&rsquo;s true name. </p>
      
      <p>When Jialy stepped into the spring, Liba impetuously stepped forward. And when Osiler demanded &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;, Liba immediately cried out &ldquo;Ansil!&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>Jialy&rsquo;s horn intensely glowed a miraculous dark blue. And as quick as that, Jialy replied &ldquo;My name is Ansil&rdquo;, and the forest turned blue with the light of the unicorns.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">The Blinding</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Now Tabor will step forward.&rdquo; Demanded Osiler. And Tabor did.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;We know Tabor, all of us. And we know his gentle heart and wise insight. We all know Tabor&rsquo;s joyful yellow song, and we all know the forest he tends, as it is verdant and lively and home to many friends. Not all know of Tabor&rsquo;s sacrifice, but today I will inform you. Three moons past, a group of 4 of The Men came through the gates. These Men were not like the ones we have met before, but they were angry and hostile and they meant us harm. Harm! They had long knives as sharp as our horns, but they had no magic. Tabor was able to drive these Men back through the gates, and he sealed it from passage from their dominion for one hundred years as is custom. But he paid a tax, Unicorns. He paid a tax that we must all bear, for one Men he made fall with his horn, and for that life his color has dimmed. A small matter, though, for today it will replenish.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Unicorns rejoice, for Tabor has been chosen, and we will now perform the blinding!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>Osiler raised his right hoof, and he splashed it down heavily into the spring. And out of a new mist, a translucent show of luminescence in the form of a unicorn became partway visible. This was Elphren, the currently blinded! And Elphren turned to face Tabor, and with two graceful motions he thrust his intangible horn into Tabor&rsquo;s eyes. As he did this, wispy threads of light flew away from his form and into Tabor&rsquo;s. And as that was taking place, Elphren became solid. When the spectacle was over, Elphren stood full-bodied facing a semi-transparent memory of Tabor. And on queue, the entire herd of unicorns surrounding the two lowered their heads, and from their horns came their individual colors, and those colors went into Tabor&rsquo;s body and his body flashed a bright white light, and he was gone.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">The Dream Casting</p>
      
      <p>When the light had faded, and they were cloaked in darkness, Osiler continued. &ldquo;This Convergence is the fourth alignment all three Equis Planets since the splitting of the realms. As such, it is a great honor bestowed upon Eranor to cast new dreams. Tonight marks one year since our last casting, and we have been blessed by the wonderful dreams cast by Shelse; may we all take a moment now to send her our gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And there was a smattering of snickers and a number of neighs and a whinny, and Shelse glowed bright and demurely. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Eranor, please begin.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And the herd watched stoically as Eranor stepped forward into the spring. </p>
      
      <p>Eranor spoke. &ldquo;Thank you, Osiler, and thank you all for this privilege. I have put special attention into my efforts this year for each of you. May these dreams bring you joy.&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>With that, she reared up onto her hind legs, and when she came crashing down, a great cloud of vapor formed around her. From inside the mist, a turbulent cyclone formed from Eranor&rsquo;s horn, and with a terrific gesture, Eranor rose again to her hind legs and the whirlwind shot up into the sky. Great clouds formed, magically illuminated, and they soon filled the sky. And as quickly as it had begun, it was over, and Eranor was unveiled in the spring facing Osiler again but small wisps of dream cloud vapor clung to her head and horn.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">The Wishing</p>
      
      <p>All the unicorns cheered, and a warm rush of energy came over them. But Aila, who had seen hundreds of these ceremonies before, felt a nagging tug. She tried to brush it away with the flick of her tail, but it persisted, and she realized that she was feeling something strange. It was excitement, for her wishing was nearly upon her, but it was another feeling too – one she was unaccustomed to. She was… afraid. But what of? She would finally make her wish, and she would love, and mate! This was meant to be a good thing, right? Why was she afraid? She knew her wishing song, and she&rsquo;d been singing all day so she knew her voice works. And she knew what she wanted! Didn&rsquo;t she? </p>
      
      <p>And there it was. Doubt. Aila, deep in her thoughts, finally realized that she wasn&rsquo;t sure that what she wanted was actually what she wanted. Mating a tall fine stallion sounded great. But surely there were other options! What else could they be? Why was she only now considering this? What had happened to her over the past months and years? She felt like she had been under a spell, and now here she was, confounded and instead of being overjoyed she was panicked. She inadvertently snorted at herself, and her neighbor, Kylie, looked over at her inquisitively. And she asked &ldquo;What?&rdquo;, and Aila, embarrassed, replied, &ldquo;Nothing, just excited.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>Kylie and Aila had been friends their whole lives - why was she hiding herself from her now? The panic was rising! Why couldn&rsquo;t she just say that she was afraid she had decided upon the wrong wish? Wait, the wrong wish?! Was is really the wrong wish? Wasn&rsquo;t this what every mare wishes for? But in her heart she knew that it wasn&rsquo;t what she wanted. She wanted something else.. but what was it? She had always loved her long adventures with Liba most of all. Maybe that was it. Aila was getting frantic. Maybe what was it? Adventure? She already had that! And she thought about her moments looking into the other realms.. it was forbidden but she would love to see them! And Aila felt a warm soothing sensation and she knew that she had changed her mind.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;And now, we will adjourn temporarily, as we make our way to the Wishing Stage.&rdquo; Commanded Osiler, the Great Stallion. His horn flashed a dark purple light that reflected eerily off his smooth dark features. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;We have one Wish Maker, tonight. Aila, you will remain here. Wait for your shooting star to arrive, then do not tarry.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And he led the herd through the two curved trees and back into the darkness beyond, and soon Aila was alone.</p>
    
    
      <p className="section-title">Aila's Star</p>

      <p>She waited patiently. As she gazed up at the stars, her thoughts went back to that day when she and her cousin Liba had peeked through the gates to the world of The Men. The Men were an almost mythical race, far removed from everyday Unicorn life. They were known to be small, upright beings, of an unpredictable nature. But yes, they were real, and on occasion they had been known to find their way here to our realm. </p>

      <p>The first of The Men to come through the gates were sensitive and easily startled, the old stories told. And they were artists, and they spoke to the Unicorns with pictures that they drew in the ground with sticks. The Unicorns at the time thought them to be kind and inquisitive and rather unsophisticated. When the leader of that first party of The Men drew a crude direction of the three of them and the unicorn they were speaking to, Brax (it is told) whinnied and said to them, &rdquo;Yes! That is you, and that is me, together!&rdquo; He was amused by the drawing of the obvious, but he couldn't possibly have know the effect that his statement would have.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of years later The Men came again. This time there were six members of their herd; though they are all rather small, two were larger than the rest, two were of medium stalk, and two of them were tiny. The tiny ones were delighted when they saw the herd – this was not Aila's herd, but another (The Zengoli, if you are curious or want to keep track) that grazes far to the north. And it is remembered that the littlest of The Men had the ability to actually speak to the Unicorns they met! They had very little to say, but what they did say pleased those there then. They <em>loved</em> us. And probably because the Unicorns felt such love from the little The Men, they became close with those Men. And The Men lived here, in our realm for several years.</p>

      <p>And perhaps it because they were so close to The Men that the falling that occurred was so devastating. For it is told that one of The Men cast a rope around the mare named Marissella, and he leaped upon her, and he tied her with the rope around the mouth, and although she protested and insisted that he remove himself, he did not, and she therefore dispelled him with her horn. And the other of The Men saw this occur and then <em>he</em> threw rope at her, and so she dispelled the rope. And when he ran into the forest, it is said that Marissella followed, and Bren, her mate saw this and joined her, and though they ran super super super fast they only caught up with The Men when they reached the abode they had built out of dead trees. </p>

      <p>When the Unicorns arrived, they were curious why The Men had become hostile, and they meant to inquire. Marissella roared out her questions, and then there was a tremendous loud clap of thunder that came from the house, and Bren fell. Marissella cried out in alarm to her herd, and then went to Bren's side to revive him, but there was another loud clap and she fell. By the time Thossler the Great Stallion arrived at the house, The Men had cut the horn off of Marissella's head, and when Thossler dispelled the other Men, he had cut halfway through Bren's. When the medium sized and littlest of The Men saw the Great Stallion arrive and their large one fall, they shrieked and ran, and the Great Stallion Thossler shepherded them to the gates of the realms, and he forced them back through the Gate of The Men, and he used all the color in his body to seal the gate for a hundred years. Marissella could not be revived, but Thossler's last act as Great Stallion of the herd was to revive Bren. </p>

      <p>It is remembered that Bren stayed in that place, by the body of his love, for seven years, until the last traces of her body had been carried away by ants.</p>

      <p>There had been several other times that The Men had visited, but none so impactful as Thossler's stand. Unicorns became wary of the little beasts, and whenever The Men came, they would politely insist that they go back whence they came. And that reminded Aila of something that the Great Stallion Osiler had said – poor Tabor had to dispel one of The Men! How awful! He would carry that with him for many years, if not the rest of his life. Thankfully the lighting ceremony during his blinding would restore his colors – next year when he got his eyes back, that is. But what a terror he had suffered. And what exactly had happened!? The Men had come at us with knives!? Whatever for?</p>

      <p>Her own glimpse into the world of The Men had been a cacophony of random images. She had seen immense forests the size of mountains filled with massive rectangular trees, and she had seen a tube filled with rows and rows of The Men sitting and staring at colorful magic squares, and she had seen The Men of all shapes and sizes in huge crowds. And The Men made such noises! Sad noises, happy noises, explosive noises... noises of every possible size and feeling. She had seen two of The Men walking together, with their arms around each other, but the stopped and put their faces and bodies together as if they wished to become one. And she had seen two of The Men on a stage surrounded by a monstrous room full of them, and they were swinging their arms at each other. But the one thing she saw that she couldn't stop thinking about was one of The Men on top of a horse running through the forest. And the thing she couldn't help herself from thinking about was that the horse was clearly delighted.</p>

      <p>Aila was troubled. And that feeling of being afraid had come back, in a new form. She was tracking down the emotion when she felt a warmth in her horn in the sky to the southeast. And she looked up to see her star flying across the dark night sky.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Dear Star&rdquo;, she thought as she looked over at the tunnel leading into the dark forest. &ldquo;What am I to do? I want to see the world of The Men, but I am afraid.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>When she looked back up to sky it had vanished – hidden on the other side of the planet.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Wishing Ceremony</p>

      <p>Aila walked through the long aisles towards the great hall, where she knew the herd would be waiting. She knew the way well, so there was no risk of her getting lost. Not only had she been coming here for Unicorn Ceremonies for a hundred years, but she used to come here to play with the Minotaur when she was a young filly. Minnow (as she called him) hated it when she would almost let him catch her but then phase though one of the walls, but Aila loved doing it. Once she sent poor Minnow into such a rage that he fisted his way through the solid stone wall just in time to see her tail flick goodbye as she trotted through to the forest. Of course as she matured she felt bad for the poor bull-headed little beast, and she did what she could to make amends. For instance once she let him get a hold of her tail – just enough so that he was able to pluck a single strand from her tresses. And to this day he wears that hair around his neck, so she knew they were likely even.</p>

      <p>But today she had serious business, and so she trepidatiously but intently walked through the series of turns and twists of the labyrinth and soon found herself in the great chamber of the Sirens. Ahead, the sisters Thelzie and Mollpe were singing their beautiful harmonies, accompanied by what sounded like a small harp. Their song had no magical effect on her, but Aila tuned in momentarily and was struck with melancholy. The music was soft and mysterious, almost a whisper, and it created a susurrous din throughout the hall that relaxed her spirit. She pushed on, and as she crossed the central bridge over the circular pool, she caught sight of Mollpe twisting through the dark water. </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your song is enchanting, Mollpe&rdquo;, Aila sent delicately. &ldquo;It calms me, and I am grateful.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Mollpe finished singing her current phrase, and she breached the water while arching her body backward through the air and resubmerged.</p>

      <p>Aila continued onward. She came to the great gate that lead out to the Clearing, and paused for the briefest of moments. With a deep breath and a slow exhalation she exited the hall into the night. </p>

      <p>First she passed the namelings. She recognized Flaena and Ry, as they were both on either side of the aisle looking excitedly at her as she passed. And there was Morsha! Whose name she had found! She was filled with a brief but poignant joy. And there were young stallions Shax and Artax, each looking at her with a cultured indifference but both inwardly hoping to catch her eye. </p>

      <p>She stepped into the center of the clearing and approached the ring of elders. Her hooves fell effortlessly into the divots that had worn into the stone before the great dais. She thought of all the realms – how many were there? Twelve or a thousand and twelve, she couldn't remember at the moment. And she thought about that day she and Liba had peered into the world of The Men. She smiled and looked up at the Dais. </p>

      <p>Osiler the Great Stallion was before her on the podium, standing tall and stately above the rest of the elders. Instead of his typical scowl, he appeared eager and almost happy. Aila scanned the ring of elders behind him. Her sister Elsie was to the far left – unlike Aila's dream she didn't appear annoyed at all but actually happy. Her father Odon, Liba, Pico, Trin, Era, Plassiler, Vestra, Sastari, Flamler, Trace, Aeina, Azren, Jal, and finally her lovely mother Eranor, and they were all looking at her with love and expectation. </p>

      <p>Eranor's green eyes flashed and Aila her her gentle urging, &ldquo;Go on dear.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Aila looked down at her beautiful hooves, took a deep breath, looked up directly into the eyes of Osiler and sang out, &ldquo;I wish free passage to and from the world of The Men.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>There was a long pause then wherein nothing happened. No one moved. No fly flitted a wing. Leaves that were halfway along on their voyage to the ground froze where they were. The Clearing – a great field encircled by a stand of tall pines and presently occupied by a coterie of Unicorns – was silent.</p>

      <p>Osiler's eager and almost happy expression slowly shifted. First his slack jaw and slightly open lips tightened and closed. Then his relaxed ears rotated forward. When his eyes narrowed (and did they turn red?), Aila felt the gravity of her wish. Had she made a terrible misstep? Her heart began to sink as she looked around and saw the same look on her father Odon's face.</p>

      <p>Osiler spoke quietly but against the heavy silence his words stood with the weight of the megaliths. </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is forbidden.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>At that, Aila filled up with a terrible energy. </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Forbidden?&rdquo; She quietly inquired.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;FORBIDDEN!&rdquo; Osiler cried. </p>

      <p>His voice echoed though the Siren's hall behind them, and around in circles guided by the pines as it ascended to the vastness of the sky in order to boom appropriately. </p>

      <p>Aila both exploded and imploded. Her body was filled with dread. No, Terror. No, maybe it was dread. She had never angered Osiler before, and she had never been <em>yelled at</em> before, and she found a powerful distaste for both. What had she done that was so wrong? Why did he yell so forcefully!? She was agitated - every cell in her body wanted to distance itself from Osiler in its own direction. Aila felt that tension. Her mind's eye flashed to Landry rabbit's contorted body stretched out while pegged by her horn as she revived him this morning, and she wondered if this is what dying and coming back to life might feel like. </p>

      <p>She again scanned her periphery, seeking solace or comfort from anywhere, anyone. But everyone seems to be in a similar state of shock. Aila looked back and forth, all around her. She looked up to the sky, following Osiler's voice, and saw a crow circling far above. And in the distance she saw some other young Unicorn's star racing across the night sky. </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I wish I had wings so that I might fly away from here.&rdquo; Aila sang before nurturing the thought. But as the words left her mouth she felt the magic conforming. There was a flurry of sounds now, whinnying and nickering and some gasping and some chattering. But all of that was far off in the distance. Aila's entire world consisted of herself, the insane wish she had just made, Osiler's flummoxed expression, and her incredible desire to be anywhere but where she stood.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;So it is done.&rdquo; Voiced Osiler. </p>

      <p>His words broke the spell, and Aila began a new one. She stood up on her hind legs, roared a fierce roar, and she stretched her illustrious wings open wider and wider for all to see. </p>

      <p>And then she flew away.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Dispersing</p>

      <p>The herd stared in amazement as her transfigured form lofted upwards in a gradual spiral until she crested the tips of the pines and was gone. Eranor called out to her to no avail. After the initial shock wore off, there was a chatter of animated voices as scattered members of the herd gave voice to their surprise and amazement. Eranor was distressed. Elsie and Trin comforted her. Osiler stood motionless looking skyward, his focus turned towards Ilo, or maybe Lastri, or possible it was Orthe. It was one of the three equine planets that were ever present in the sky. I think. What he pondered there, where his mind went then none knows. For minutes he stood in silence, and then he left the Clearing through the Siren's Hall without another word.</p>

      <p>The ceremony ended in a hushed cacophony. </p>

      <p>The unicorns dispersed. Ee and Artax, the young stallions exchangers impressed and surprised faces with each other. Ee was unabashedly smitten, having always been drawn to Aila's free spirit and independence. Artax was intrigued – Aila's wings were impressive and in their way, beautiful – but he felt uneasy. Being the largest in the herd apart from Osiler and Odon, he had always presumed that Aila would chose him to mate, if not a wish-stallion. Now, his immediate reaction was disappointment – he knew deep down that he had no desire to sire foals with wings! Ee on the other hand was enchanted, and Artax's thoughts comforted him. He realized the oddity of Aila's new form but it didn't diminish his esteem for her, it increased it.</p>

      <p>Eranor and Trin left the clearing last. Trin stayed close to Eranor's flank, comforting her. She was exhausted from the dream making and now she didn't know what to think. Her youngest daughter had always been a free spirit, but this was an unexpected event! Eranor had heard Aila's song many times over the past few moons – Why had she not wished for her stallion? And where had she gone! Why did she want to visit the realm of The Men? There were too many unanswered questions, and she was too exhausted to investigate further. She needed rest, and she needed the restorative energy Aila had been cultivating. She hoped she would see her soon as she made her way to her dwelling in the shade of her friend the Sycamore.</p>

      <p>As Eranor crested the hill on the last stretch of her walk home, she saw Aila's signature pink glow near the Sycamore. Eranor sighed a deep sigh, and felt a wash of relief. She may have sprouted wings and flown away but at least she remembered her dear mother. </p>

      <p>&quot;I think I'll leave you now&quot;, Trin said as they drew closer. &quot;I'm sure the two of you will have much to discuss and Trace will be glad for companionship this night.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Thank you, Trin, I've appreciated your companionship tonight myself.&quot;</p>

      
      <p className="section-title">The Reckoning</p>

      <p>&quot;Aila, you came!&quot; Eranor sent as she approached the tree and her beautiful pinkish shimmering daughter. Aila's coat was white of color, but her color was pink. Her horn, imbued with youth and ripe with magic, was constantly emitting a low level glow that clung to her form and wrapped her body in a subtle charming pink light. Her glow responded to her emotional state, and Aila was currently glowing with a dark, almost red, sheen. And her wings! Tucked in their resting position, Eranor hardly noticed them at first. Now she took a moment to gaze upon her daughter's new form. Even in the cover of night, she could distinguish the new shapes and the texture of feathers.</p>

      <p>&quot;Well aren't they just lovely. Come on, let me have a look.&quot; She demanded.</p>

      <p>&quot;Oh! You like them?&quot; Aila inquired as she slowly unfurled and rose her wingtips wide.</p>

      <p>&quot;I didn't say that.&quot; Eranor grinned. &quot;I think they're just incredible. I might not have chosen them for myself but you have.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Yes, mother, I have! And I don't know why and I don't know what to do. And I do love flying! But what have I done!?&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I don't know Aila, but it is done, and there is no going back. I'm sorry you are distressed.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I'm not distressed! I have wings!&quot; Aila cried. </p>

      <p>In all actuality, she was in fact distressed, she just didn't realize it yet. But she would soon.</p>

      <p>&quot;Yes, dear. You do. You have an infinite future in front of you to come to terms with that fact. But there's nothing that I can do about it right here and now.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I know...&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;But there is something that you can do for me.&quot; Eranor was extremely exhausted, and she lowered her head. &quot;I am quite tired.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Oh mother! I forgot your dream casting! You're so pale! Let me help you.&quot; </p>

      <p>Eranor stepped over to her clearing in the tall grass and slowly and carefully lay down. Aila followed, and when her mother was settled she leaned down and tucked her chin to point her horn towards her dam's chest. She slowly impaled her horn into her mother's side, aiming for the heart. When she could push no further, she closed her eyes and began expelling her energy into her mother's body. Where horn pierced hide there was a bright ring of bright pink, and where Aila's horn was exposed there was an incredible bright white that lit the eerie scene. </p>

      <p>It took a long time – Aila had been saving her magic for several weeks now – but eventually the process was complete. Aila withdrew her horn, and the glow diffused. Eranor was fast asleep, but her color had returned and she was breathing peacefully.</p>

      
      <p className="section-title">The Flight</p>

      <p>Aila grazed nearby until dawn – that mystical hour before the day had awoken. The grass here was good and substantial, but minty, and Aila had never particularly cared for mint. She grazed, and while restoring her mother's depleted magical energy had calmed her, she was still at odds with herself. Why on Earth had she made such an impetuous wish? Why, not even Liba had done anything this crazy, and everyone always said she was the impish one. Well, it appears she was the wild one now. Wings! What stallion would ever want a mare with <em>wings</em>!? What of her friends? Would they treat her differently now? No, what a silly question. <em>Of course they would.</em> This was distressing.</p>

      <p>&quot;I am distressed!&quot; Aila realized.</p>

      <p>She wanted desperately to talk to Liba, but it would be some time before that was a possibility, and Aila was agitated. Given her options, she decided to go for a fly. She reared up, spread her wings, and when she pushed them down her body went up. And she repeated the process. And it was actually quite easy to get the hang of, now that she knew what it was all about.</p>

      <p>Her first flight had been a bit of an emotional battle. At first it was terrifying, but she was so angry and confused that she didn't let it get to her. But now she had time for it to really sink in – horses were not meant to fly! Countering that was her experience. &quot;I have already done this, and it worked out fine, so surely it will be fine now&quot;, she thought as she watched the sycamore tree and mother below shrink smaller and smaller. </p>

      <p>As she rose higher and higher, she started moving forward, which she found almost as easy as thinking it. She just leaned into the direction she wanted to go and her wings did the rest. And then she had the thought to try <em>hopping</em>. Aila loved to hop and jump when she was land bound, so it was a natural instinct. But when she hopped in the air she flew in a dramatic arc hundreds of meters long. It was exhilarating! And so she air hopped for a while, and then she had another though. &quot;I wonder if I can <em>fly</em> super super super fast!?&quot; And she tried. And guess what.. ok I know you already guessed it. She could. She could fly super super super fast! And if you were here on the ground to see her flying by you would swear it was just a meteorite flying by – a great sharp pink line draw across the sky. </p>
