      <h1>Aila, The Winged Unicorn</h1>
      
      <hr />
      
      <p className="section-title">I: The Day</p>
      
      <p className="section-title">The Dream</p>
      
      <p>The young unicorn Aila was dozing in the meadow in the hour past dawn — in the hour before day — when she awoke with a jump. </p>
      
      <p>She had been dreaming of the wishing ceremony, and in her dream she had walked down the long aisles past the Minotaurs, and around the radiant blue pool where the beloved Siren sisters sang their beautiful harmonies, and then up to the great dais where Osiler the Great Stallion waited, and she stepped her manicured hooves into the divots in the stone that had worn there after eons of similar events, and she froze. </p>
      
      <p>She knew that she must sing, and she knew the song she must sing – she&rsquo;d been practicing it for the past two months day and night – but she could not utter a sound. She looked around at the patient elders who stood in a semi-circle behind the Great Stallion nervously. Elsie, her eldest sister was on the far left and she appeared annoyed. Beside her, Odon, her father, dark and grave, and the largest of the unicorns in the room apart from Osiler. Then came her older cousins, Liba and Pico, and her aunts, and her uncles, and well, everyone. And on her far right-hoof, her mother, Eranor, slender and tall, and purely white with stunning green eyes. Eranor nodded her onward when their eyes met, and that slight nudge broke Aila from her trepidatious trance. </p>
      
      <p>She briefly collected her thoughts and recalled the words that laid out her wish. Words that in the human&rsquo;s language would translate to falling in love with a handsome tall stallion and raising beautiful and kind foals. It was what nearly every young unicorn maiden had wished for, for several eons. But when she set herself and opened her mouth, her breath came out, but Aila found that she could not make a sound.</p>
      
      <p className="section-title">The Awakening</p>
      
      <p>She bolted upright which frightened Squalmy, her bunny friend who had been sleeping at her side for warmth, and he darted into the forest through the tall reeds. Three butterflies flitted up into the morning air, and one flitted right past her eyelashes and she flicked her tail harmlessly in mock annoyance.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Oh jee,&rdquo; she neighed aloud, Today <em>is</em> the wishing ceremony!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>She hopped a few times, kicking the leftover sleep out of her haunches, and sang out a long neigh, both to test out her voice and to express her joy to her friends in the meadow. The wishing ceremony was only the most important day in a young unicorn&rsquo;s life, and she&rsquo;d been waiting for it and dreaming about it for all of her 100 years. Well, to be fair she&rsquo;d only been aware of it for 99 1/2 years, so that would be a more accurate number if you&rsquo;re particular about such things. But as she bounded towards the endless golden fields of Naranthal where the elders would surely be gathered, something small troubled the young unicorn. She&rsquo;d never had a <em>bad</em> dream about the wishing ceremony. Why now, she wondered? </p>
      
      <p>Naranthal was still slumbering when she arrived, so she grazed a bit on the tall golden grass. Her head was full of the events to come later in the day. The namings, the blinding, the dream casting, and finally her wishing. She was especially excited about her cousin Liba&rsquo;s new foal who had just turned twenty and was to be given his name today. Aila had always called him Jialy, but many of the other unicorn&rsquo;s names for him were splendid as well. And she was excited for Tabor who was to be blinded for the year so that he could lead the herd to the best pastures - it was a special honor reserved for only the eldest and wisest. And of course Eranor would be casting dreams for them this year, as it was the fourth convergence of the three important equine planets, and that meant that she, Aila, would be in charge of caring for her dam when the ceremonies and festivities were over. Which meant that she would have to graze even more than usual today if her horn was to have enough energy to share! It was going to be a big day!</p>
      
      <p>She was bodiless in such thoughts when Fisko the fox came bounding out of the forest into the tall grass excitedly. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Oh! Aila, Aila! Come quick! Follow me! It&rsquo;s trouble!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;What is it, Fisko, what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; She asked. </p>
      
      <p>She didn&rsquo;t really mouth those words, though, because, as you know, horses and unicorns can&rsquo;t speak. We can only whinny, and neigh, and snort, and huff, and groan, and grunt, and sigh, and squeal, and sing, and bray, and roar... and okay, we can make a whole sweep of sounds, but you know what I mean. We certainly don&rsquo;t <em>talk</em>. No, instead, Aila just thought her thoughts, and <em>sent</em> them. But the effect was the same, so what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Landry and Squalmy! Hurry!&rdquo; The fox urged. </p>
      
      <p>Aila complied and followed Fisko into the woods full of her friends Cedar, and Oak, and Douglas, and Creek, and Slug, and Beetle, and Fern, and Bramble, and Ivy, and... I&rsquo;m doing it again, aren&rsquo;t I. I&rsquo;ll try to be more concise. She followed the fox into the woods, and though Fisko was fast, she was untroubled by keeping up. She was a unicorn and if she wanted she could run super, super, super fast. But she stayed behind Fisko to see what the trouble was.</p>
      
      <p>Landry was a bunny she had known for many summers, and when she saw his body flat on the ground and motionless, she whinnied in shock. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to him!?&rdquo; she exclaimed. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Well, him and Squalmy were hopping together, and each was trying to out-hop the other, and that&rsquo;s when I saw them and I laughed because they were about to hop themselves into the mud! And it&rsquo;s still funny, and if Landry wasn&rsquo;t fallen I&rsquo;d laugh again right now, because Squalmy did hop right into the mud, and when it was Landry&rsquo;s turn to hop next, he didn&rsquo;t! And so Squalmy hopped on out and thumped Landry in the ear and then Landry kicked Squalmy back and then they traded hops again but on each other&rsquo;s heads. And they were real upset with each other, too, and then they traded such very not nice words with each other, and then Squalmy hopped off towards the brook, and Landry tried to hop away too but when he jumped up into the air he just sort of froze, and then fell, and he&rsquo;s still here where he fell on the ground, right here...&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Oh Landry, you poor poor thing!&rdquo; Thought the unicorn. </p>
      
      <p>Aila bent her nose down to the ground, where her friend Landry lay motionless, and she nudged his furry body with her snout, and she was filled with such a tremendous sadness that a tear rose in her eye. And that tear rolled down her cheek, and it rolled off into the air beneath her cheek, and the tear had just decided to make its way in a direct path to the forest floor when it was pierced by one of the sharpest things in the world: a unicorn horn. </p>
      
      <p>The tear exploded into a colorful display. Purple, and pink. and red, and orange, and green, and teal, and blue, and a thousand other colors that only unicorns can see erupted from the spot where there was once a droplet of unicorn eye water. And it flashed out in a great cloud that disappeared almost instantly. But, when it was done, Aila&rsquo;s horn had retained some of the color, and it glowed warmly in the forest shade.</p>
      
      <p>What happened next both startled and amazed Fisko and the forest of friends surrounding Aila and the rabbit. She sharply thrust her horn into his side and picked him up a few inches off the ground. And his body stretched out and his eyes went wide. If you were watching closely you would have noticed the color moving from Aila&rsquo;s horn in a spiral down into Landry&rsquo;s body, and if you were watching really close you might have noticed that the color of his fur changed from brown to slightly <em>more</em> brown. If you were here to see it, that is. </p>
      
      <p>When she lifted her head, Aila looked down at her friend, who blinked his eyes three times in quick succession, and then scratched his right ear vigorously with his right foot. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Oh Aila! You saved poor Landry! I knew you could do it!! Hahaha!!!!&rdquo; And with that, Fisko the fox leapt over a log and out of sight. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Mister Landry,&rdquo; Aila looked down at the rabbit. &ldquo;You will make haste to apologize to my friend Mister Squalmy, now, won&rsquo;t you? I believe he owes you one as well. I believe both of your feelings were hurt today.&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am, absolutely I will. And thank you ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t know what happened, but I feel.. I feel great!! And Landry bounded off.</p>
      
      <p>Aila was left alone in the forest. And even if you were here you wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed this: the quiet unicorn closed her eyes and sighed and then she swallowed, and for a moment she felt as sad and empty as a unicorn could possibly feel, as though she had swallowed a tiny bite of death.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">The Morning</p>
      
      <p>The moment passed and she found her joy as she jumped over a muddy patch on her way back to the others. Aila loved to jump, and she did so merrily several times on her way. And she saw a lovely patch of dark green clover which she snacked on momentarily, which whet her appetite for a more substantial grazing. </p>
      
      <p>When she returned to the fields of Naranthal the other unicorns were mostly all still asleep, and that was fine by her. She had an empty belly to tend! And she grazed and grazed, and when she was full she ate some more because she knew she would need her energy later. </p>
      
      <p>Liba was the first to rise and when she saw Aila she made her way over and bowed customarily. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Gracious morning to you, young filly, how are you enjoying this day so far?&rdquo; Liba inquired.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Today has been grand. I am excited, of course, about the ceremonies. I restored Landry again, and that left me a bit cold, but I&rsquo;ve warmed myself on this delicious grass and my heart is full again. And you, Liba, are you happy today? Are you excited to find Jialy&rsquo;s true name?&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I am&rdquo;, Liba emoted, but she looked aside at the rolling hills. &ldquo;I am just nervous because Levnis feels strongly that the foal&rsquo;s name will be Ogok, and as you know I would much prefer Ansil. But of course it isn&rsquo;t up to me.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I am sure that Jialy will love his name no matter what it turns out to be!&rdquo;, Aila encouraged.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I am sure. But Ogok!?&rdquo; Liba scoffed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d cry&rdquo;.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Surely not, Liba! You will find joy in his name because it is his true sound. You only fear this name because you do not believe it is correct. But if it comes to be, you will know, and your love will cover this fear. You know this!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she replied &ldquo;but still, Ogok the Great!?&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;I admit that it sounds... a bit silly.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And they both laughed, and they grazed, and Liba disturbed a sleeping Jay which she chased playfully for a bit, and Aila discovered a bit of golden clover, and thought to herself, &ldquo;What a wonderful day this is turning out to be!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>While she grazed, she thought longingly of her wish. She had of course been friends with the stallions of her herd for, well, for forever. But to truly love.. that must be the best feeling in the world, she thought. &rsquo;I bet it is magical. And my stallion will be the tallest in the heard, even taller than Odon or Osiler. He&rsquo;ll be all black, but with a hint of auburn that flashes in the sunlight, and he will be kind and powerful, and we will make a thousand foals.&rsquo; And her heart was aflutter, as she grazed and fantasized about her wish. </p>
      
      <p>But a distant reservation disturbed her reveries. Though it was unclear what, something pulled on her, nagged her, and her dreaming dissolved. And she paused and looked around at the field, and at the rolling hills, and her friend the bee buzzing by, and the forest, and the rousing heard of beautiful rising unicorns, and she took a deep breath, and she cantered off to make her preparations for the day.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">II: The Ceremony</p>
      
      <p className="section-title">The Namings</p>
      
      <p>There were to be four namings that day, and they came first so that the newest named could participate in the rest of the ceremonies. Names are very important to unicorns, for they serve to focus of all their magical energy. Without a name, a unicorn can run fast, but not super super super fast. And they can light their horns in a marvelous display, but they cannot channel that energy into acts of intention. They can bless, and they can send thoughts, but they cannot bless an individual creature, and they cannot project their thoughts as more than quiet hints. They can heal, but they cannot revive, and so for that reason, they are cared for and protected by the entire herd, and they are thought of as children without true individualism. But all of that changes with the passage of the naming ceremony.</p>
      
      <p>The foal whom Aila called Jialy was last to receive his name that day. Aila&rsquo;s names for the others were Morsha, Esper, and Thedlin. Morsha was a fine golden brown young mare, with a tremendously long blonde mane. Aila cared greatly for her as her dam was Aila&rsquo;s aunt Rostly. Aila loved all of her herd – it was her family after all – but she was especially friendly with Liba.</p>
      
      <p>Liba had a rebellious streak in her spirit that was matched by a jagged red stripe down her golden right flank. On several occasions, Aila had joined Liba on long walks far away from the herd, and they talked by opening and sharing their hearts and swirling their unformed thoughts together. Once they had even brazenly approached the gates to the other realms together, and though Aila was quite apprehensive about it, they put their noses through the distorted, swirling, images and peered into the world of The Men. They only peeked through for a moment, but what they saw confounded Aila and Liba both. For days Aila replayed disjointed scenes of Men and things that made little sense to her, but Liba was unbothered by such thoughts. Aila&rsquo;s curiosity festered, and one day she has brought it to Liba, but Liba said only that there was no need to worry themselves about the lives of Men, that they were trivial and simple, and perhaps she should have never taken Aila there. And they never did go back there together, but they did maintain a habit of going on long adventures making friends with all the beasts of their world. And thought Liba never went back to the gates, Aila one day would.</p>
      
      <p>At sundown, Morsha and the three others to be named approached the curved trees that marked the entrance to the Minotaur&rsquo;s maze with the rest of the heard at their backs. Their bodies together were striking in the waning light. Morsha was bright gold; Esper wore dappled blue; Thedlin was in white with auburn forelegs, tail, and mane; and of course Jialy was wearing his shaggy dark brown coat. In the waning light of the sun and the tinge of light from the moons, their four hides each had a distinct glow about them, while in collective they simply shone. </p>
      
      <p>From the shadows of the two great curved trees at the edge of the forest emerged Osiler. Without delay he approached the four foals and when only several feet away, he rose up on his hind legs and stomped forcibly down with his front hooves. There was a great thunderous sound, and a cloud of mist arose at his feet that rose upward revealing a fresh spring of pure crystalline water. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;First.&rdquo; He boomed. And he looked down to Morsha. Because he was the Great Stallion he did not have a name for her. </p>
      
      <p>Nervous but excited, Morsha stepped forward into the pool. It glowed gently where her hooves touched, but she only sank in a few inches. She took two more small steps towards the Great Stallion and looked shyly up at him.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; Osiler cried. </p>
      
      <p>The rest of the heard, about 27 unicorns in total, were gathered behind the namelings in a wide arc. The first to call out was Morsha&rsquo;s dam, Rostly. She stepped forward, and responded, &ldquo;Tinip!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And from the horn of the unicorn standing in the pool came a strong but gentle blue light. And Rostly stepped back.</p>
      
      <p>Her sire, Trally, stepped forth. &ldquo;Ioni!&rdquo; He cried.</p>
      
      <p>And the horn of the unicorn emitted a soft orange glow.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Kalee!&rdquo; Cried Liba. And the horn glowed somewhat brighter orange.</p>
      
      <p>Aila stepped forward to take her turn. &ldquo;Morsha!&rdquo; She cried. And the horn glowed a wonderful bright pink. It was the brightest yet, and she stepped back to her place hopefully.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Kelve!&rdquo; Cried Pico, the young mare&rsquo;s uncle. The horn shone a pale green, and dimmed considerably.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Tessa!&rdquo; Cried another. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Sendry!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Eva!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Leston!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Shai!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And after a long silence, and after the light from her horn had faded, she looked up at Osiler with a newfound poise and replied, &ldquo;My name is Morsha.&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>And with that, the horn on every unicorn there in the fledgling darkness by the forest cast a marvelous explosion of bright pink light, and Morsha&rsquo;s horn was brightest of all. </p>
      
      <p>When the pink light dimmed, Osiler bowed his head, and Morsha trotted back to join the row of unicorns behind her.</p>
      
      <p>Breglin and Thorsh&rsquo;s names were chosen in a similar fashion, and while Aila&rsquo;s name Esper made a strong showing, she was joyed to learn Breglin&rsquo;s true name. </p>
      
      <p>When Jialy stepped into the spring, Liba impetuously stepped forward. And when Osiler demanded &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;, Liba immediately cried out &ldquo;Ansil!&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>Jialy&rsquo;s horn intensely glowed a miraculous dark blue. And as quick as that, Jialy replied &ldquo;My name is Ansil&rdquo;, and the forest turned blue with the light of the unicorns.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">The Blinding</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Now Tabor will step forward.&rdquo; Demanded Osiler. And Tabor did.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;We know Tabor, all of us. And we know his gentle heart and wise insight. We all know Tabor&rsquo;s joyful yellow song, and we all know the forest he tends, as it is verdant and lively and home to many friends. Not all know of Tabor&rsquo;s sacrifice, but today I will inform you. Three moons past, a group of 4 of The Men came through the gates. These Men were not like the ones we have met before, but they were angry and hostile and they meant us harm. Harm! They had long knives as sharp as our horns, but they had no magic. Tabor was able to drive these Men back through the gates, and he sealed it from passage from their dominion for one hundred years as is custom. But he paid a tax, Unicorns. He paid a tax that we must all bear, for one Men he made fall with his horn, and for that life his color has dimmed. A small matter, though, for today it will replenish.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Unicorns rejoice, for Tabor has been chosen, and we will now perform the blinding!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>Osiler raised his right hoof, and he splashed it down heavily into the spring. And out of a new mist, a translucent show of luminescence in the form of a unicorn became partway visible. This was Elphren, the currently blinded! And Elphren turned to face Tabor, and with two graceful motions he thrust his intangible horn into Tabor&rsquo;s eyes. As he did this, wispy threads of light flew away from his form and into Tabor&rsquo;s. And as that was taking place, Elphren became solid. When the spectacle was over, Elphren stood full-bodied facing a semi-transparent memory of Tabor. And on queue, the entire herd of unicorns surrounding the two lowered their heads, and from their horns came their individual colors, and those colors went into Tabor&rsquo;s body and his body flashed a bright white light, and he was gone.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">The Dream Casting</p>
      
      <p>When the light had faded, and they were cloaked in darkness, Osiler continued. &ldquo;This Convergence is the fourth alignment all three Equis Planets since the splitting of the realms. As such, it is a great honor bestowed upon Eranor to cast new dreams. Tonight marks one year since our last casting, and we have been blessed by the wonderful dreams cast by Shelse; may we all take a moment now to send her our gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And there was a smattering of snickers and a number of neighs and a whinny, and Shelse glowed bright and demurely. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Eranor, please begin.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And the herd watched stoically as Eranor stepped forward into the spring. </p>
      
      <p>Eranor spoke. &ldquo;Thank you, Osiler, and thank you all for this privilege. I have put special attention into my efforts this year for each of you. May these dreams bring you joy.&rdquo; </p>
      
      <p>With that, she reared up onto her hind legs, and when she came crashing down, a great cloud of vapor formed around her. From inside the mist, a turbulent cyclone formed from Eranor&rsquo;s horn, and with a terrific gesture, Eranor rose again to her hind legs and the whirlwind shot up into the sky. Great clouds formed, magically illuminated, and they soon filled the sky. And as quickly as it had begun, it was over, and Eranor was unveiled in the spring facing Osiler again but small wisps of dream cloud vapor clung to her head and horn.</p>
      
      
      <p className="section-title">The Wishing</p>
      
      <p>All the unicorns cheered, and a warm rush of energy came over them. But Aila, who had seen hundreds of these ceremonies before, felt a nagging tug. She tried to brush it away with the flick of her tail, but it persisted, and she realized that she was feeling something strange. It was excitement, for her wishing was nearly upon her, but it was another feeling too – one she was unaccustomed to. She was… afraid. But what of? She would finally make her wish, and she would love, and mate! This was meant to be a good thing, right? Why was she afraid? She knew her wishing song, and she&rsquo;d been singing all day so she knew her voice works. And she knew what she wanted! Didn&rsquo;t she? </p>
      
      <p>And there it was. Doubt. Aila, deep in her thoughts, finally realized that she wasn&rsquo;t sure that what she wanted was actually what she wanted. Mating a tall fine stallion sounded great. But surely there were other options! What else could they be? Why was she only now considering this? What had happened to her over the past months and years? She felt like she had been under a spell, and now here she was, confounded and instead of being overjoyed she was panicked. She inadvertently snorted at herself, and her neighbor, Kylie, looked over at her inquisitively. And she asked &ldquo;What?&rdquo;, and Aila, embarrassed, replied, &ldquo;Nothing, just excited.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>Kylie and Aila had been friends their whole lives - why was she hiding herself from her now? The panic was rising! Why couldn&rsquo;t she just say that she was afraid she had decided upon the wrong wish? Wait, the wrong wish?! Was is really the wrong wish? Wasn&rsquo;t this what every mare wishes for? But in her heart she knew that it wasn&rsquo;t what she wanted. She wanted something else.. but what was it? She had always loved her long adventures with Liba most of all. Maybe that was it. Aila was getting frantic. Maybe what was it? Adventure? She already had that! And she thought about her moments looking into the other realms.. it was forbidden but she would love to see them! And Aila felt a warm soothing sensation and she knew that she had changed her mind.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;And now, we will adjourn temporarily, as we make our way to the Wishing Stage.&rdquo; Commanded Osiler, the Great Stallion. His horn flashed a dark purple light that reflected eerily off his smooth dark features. </p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;We have one Wish Maker, tonight. Aila, you will remain here. Wait for your shooting star to arrive, then do not tarry.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>And he led the herd through the two curved trees and back into the darkness beyond, and soon Aila was alone.</p>
    
    
      <p className="section-title">Aila's Star</p>

      <p>She waited patiently. As she gazed up at the stars, her thoughts went back to that day when she and her cousin Liba had peeked through the gates to the world of The Men. The Men were an almost mythical race, far removed from everyday Unicorn life. They were known to be small, upright beings, of an unpredictable nature. But yes, they were real, and on occasion they had been known to find their way here to our realm. </p>

      <p>The first of The Men to come through the gates were sensitive and easily startled, the old stories told. And they were artists, and they spoke to the Unicorns with pictures that they drew in the ground with sticks. The Unicorns at the time thought them to be kind and inquisitive and rather unsophisticated. When the leader of that first party of The Men drew a crude direction of the three of them and the unicorn they were speaking to, Brax (it is told) whinnied and said to them, &rdquo;Yes! That is you, and that is me, together!&rdquo; He was amused by the drawing of the obvious, but he couldn't possibly have know the effect that his statement would have.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of years later The Men came again. This time there were six members of their herd; though they are all rather small, two were larger than the rest, two were of medium stalk, and two of them were tiny. The tiny ones were delighted when they saw the herd – this was not Aila's herd, but another (The Zengoli, if you are curious or want to keep track) that grazes far to the north. And it is remembered that the littlest of The Men had the ability to actually speak to the Unicorns they met! They had very little to say, but what they did say pleased those there then. They <em>loved</em> us. And probably because the Unicorns felt such love from the little The Men, they became close with those Men. And The Men lived here, in our realm for several years.</p>

      <p>And perhaps it because they were so close to The Men that the falling that occurred was so devastating. For it is told that one of The Men cast a rope around the mare named Marissella, and he leaped upon her, and he tied her with the rope around the mouth, and although she protested and insisted that he remove himself, he did not, and she therefore dispelled him with her horn. And the other of The Men saw this occur and then <em>he</em> threw rope at her, and so she dispelled the rope. And when he ran into the forest, it is said that Marissella followed, and Bren, her mate saw this and joined her, and though they ran super super super fast they only caught up with The Men when they reached the abode they had built out of dead trees. </p>

      <p>When the Unicorns arrived, they were curious why The Men had become hostile, and they meant to inquire. Marissella roared out her questions, and then there was a tremendous loud clap of thunder that came from the house, and Bren fell. Marissella cried out in alarm to her herd, and then went to Bren's side to revive him, but there was another loud clap and she fell. By the time Thossler the Great Stallion arrived at the house, The Men had cut the horn off of Marissella's head, and when Thossler dispelled the other Men, he had cut halfway through Bren's. When the medium sized and littlest of The Men saw the Great Stallion arrive and their large one fall, they shrieked and ran, and the Great Stallion Thossler shepherded them to the gates of the realms, and he forced them back through the Gate of The Men, and he used all the color in his body to seal the gate for a hundred years. Marissella could not be revived, but Thossler's last act as Great Stallion of the herd was to revive Bren. </p>

      <p>It is remembered that Bren stayed in that place, by the body of his love, for seven years, until the last traces of her body had been carried away by ants.</p>

      <p>There had been several other times that The Men had visited, but none so impactful as Thossler's stand. Unicorns became wary of the little beasts, and whenever The Men came, they would politely insist that they go back whence they came. And that reminded Aila of something that the Great Stallion Osiler had said – poor Tabor had to dispel one of The Men! How awful! He would carry that with him for many years, if not the rest of his life. Thankfully the lighting ceremony during his blinding would restore his colors – next year when he got his eyes back, that is. But what a terror he had suffered. And what exactly had happened!? The Men had come at us with knives!? Whatever for?</p>

      <p>Her own glimpse into the world of The Men had been a cacophony of random images. She had seen immense forests the size of mountains filled with massive rectangular trees, and she had seen a tube filled with rows and rows of The Men sitting and staring at colorful magic squares, and she had seen The Men of all shapes and sizes in huge crowds. And The Men made such noises! Sad noises, happy noises, explosive noises... noises of every possible size and feeling. She had seen two of The Men walking together, with their arms around each other, but the stopped and put their faces and bodies together as if they wished to become one. And she had seen two of The Men on a stage surrounded by a monstrous room full of them, and they were swinging their arms at each other. But the one thing she saw that she couldn't stop thinking about was one of The Men on top of a horse running through the forest. And the thing she couldn't help herself from thinking about was that the horse was clearly delighted.</p>

      <p>Aila was troubled. And that feeling of being afraid had come back, in a new form. She was tracking down the emotion when she felt a warmth in her horn in the sky to the southeast. And she looked up to see her star flying across the dark night sky.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Dear Star&rdquo;, she thought as she looked over at the tunnel leading into the dark forest. &ldquo;What am I to do? I want to see the world of The Men, but I am afraid.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>When she looked back up to sky it had vanished – hidden on the other side of the planet.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Wishing Ceremony</p>

      <p>Aila walked through the long aisles towards the great hall, where she knew the herd would be waiting. She knew the way well, so there was no risk of her getting lost. Not only had she been coming here for Unicorn Ceremonies for a hundred years, but she used to come here to play with the Minotaur when she was a young filly. Minnow (as she called him) hated it when she would almost let him catch her but then phase though one of the walls, but Aila loved doing it. Once she sent poor Minnow into such a rage that he fisted his way through the solid stone wall just in time to see her tail flick goodbye as she trotted through to the forest. Of course as she matured she felt bad for the poor bull-headed little beast, and she did what she could to make amends. For instance once she let him get a hold of her tail – just enough so that he was able to pluck a single strand from her tresses. And to this day he wears that hair around his neck, so she knew they were likely even.</p>

      <p>But today she had serious business, and so she trepidatiously but intently walked through the series of turns and twists of the labyrinth and soon found herself in the great chamber of the Sirens. Ahead, the sisters Thelzie and Mollpe were singing their beautiful harmonies, accompanied by what sounded like a small harp. Their song had no magical effect on her, but Aila tuned in momentarily and was struck with melancholy. The music was soft and mysterious, almost a whisper, and it created a susurrous din throughout the hall that relaxed her spirit. She pushed on, and as she crossed the central bridge over the circular pool, she caught sight of Mollpe twisting through the dark water. </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your song is enchanting, Mollpe&rdquo;, Aila sent delicately. &ldquo;It calms me, and I am grateful.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Mollpe finished singing her current phrase, and she breached the water while arching her body backward through the air and resubmerged.</p>

      <p>Aila continued onward. She came to the great gate that lead out to the Clearing, and paused for the briefest of moments. With a deep breath and a slow exhalation she exited the hall into the night. </p>

      <p>First she passed the namelings. She recognized Flaena and Ry, as they were both on either side of the aisle looking excitedly at her as she passed. And there was Morsha! Whose name she had found! She was filled with a brief but poignant joy. And there were young stallions Shax and Artax, each looking at her with a cultured indifference but both inwardly hoping to catch her eye. </p>

      <p>She stepped into the center of the clearing and approached the ring of elders. Her hooves fell effortlessly into the divots that had worn into the stone before the great dais. She thought of all the realms – how many were there? Twelve or a thousand and twelve, she couldn't remember at the moment. And she thought about that day she and Liba had peered into the world of The Men. She smiled and looked up at the Dais. </p>

      <p>Osiler the Great Stallion was before her on the podium, standing tall and stately above the rest of the elders. Instead of his typical scowl, he appeared eager and almost happy. Aila scanned the ring of elders behind him. Her sister Elsie was to the far left – unlike Aila's dream she didn't appear annoyed at all but actually happy. Her father Odon, Liba, Pico, Trin, Era, Plassiler, Vestra, Sastari, Flamler, Trace, Aeina, Azren, Jal, and finally her lovely mother Eranor, and they were all looking at her with love and expectation. </p>

      <p>Eranor's green eyes flashed and Aila her her gentle urging, &ldquo;Go on dear.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Aila looked down at her beautiful hooves, took a deep breath, looked up directly into the eyes of Osiler and sang out, &ldquo;I wish free passage to and from the world of The Men.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>There was a long pause then wherein nothing happened. No one moved. No fly flitted a wing. Leaves that were halfway along on their voyage to the ground froze where they were. The Clearing – a great field encircled by a stand of tall pines and presently occupied by a coterie of Unicorns – was silent.</p>

      <p>Osiler's eager and almost happy expression slowly shifted. First his slack jaw and slightly open lips tightened and closed. Then his relaxed ears rotated forward. When his eyes narrowed (and did they turn red?), Aila felt the gravity of her wish. Had she made a terrible misstep? Her heart began to sink as she looked around and saw the same look on her father Odon's face.</p>

      <p>Osiler spoke quietly but against the heavy silence his words stood with the weight of the megaliths. </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is forbidden.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>At that, Aila filled up with a terrible energy. </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Forbidden?&rdquo; She quietly inquired.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;FORBIDDEN!&rdquo; Osiler cried. </p>

      <p>His voice echoed though the Siren's hall behind them, and around in circles guided by the pines as it ascended to the vastness of the sky in order to boom appropriately. </p>

      <p>Aila both exploded and imploded. Her body was filled with dread. No, Terror. No, maybe it was dread. She had never angered Osiler before, and she had never been <em>yelled at</em> before, and she found a powerful distaste for both. What had she done that was so wrong? Why did he yell so forcefully!? She was agitated - every cell in her body wanted to distance itself from Osiler in its own direction. Aila felt that tension. Her mind's eye flashed to Landry rabbit's contorted body stretched out while pegged by her horn as she revived him this morning, and she wondered if this is what dying and coming back to life might feel like. </p>

      <p>She again scanned her periphery, seeking solace or comfort from anywhere, anyone. But everyone seems to be in a similar state of shock. Aila looked back and forth, all around her. She looked up to the sky, following Osiler's voice, and saw a crow circling far above. And in the distance she saw some other young Unicorn's star racing across the night sky. </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I wish I had wings so that I might fly away from here.&rdquo; Aila sang before nurturing the thought. But as the words left her mouth she felt the magic conforming. There was a flurry of sounds now, whinnying and nickering and some gasping and some chattering. But all of that was far off in the distance. Aila's entire world consisted of herself, the insane wish she had just made, Osiler's flummoxed expression, and her incredible desire to be anywhere but where she stood.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;So it is done.&rdquo; Voiced Osiler. </p>

      <p>His words broke the spell, and Aila began a new one. She stood up on her hind legs, roared a fierce roar, and she stretched her illustrious wings open wider and wider for all to see. </p>

      <p>And then she flew away.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Dispersing</p>

      <p>The herd stared in amazement as her transfigured form lofted upwards in a gradual spiral until she crested the tips of the pines and was gone. Eranor called out to her to no avail. After the initial shock wore off, there was a chatter of animated voices as scattered members of the herd gave voice to their surprise and amazement. Eranor was distressed. Elsie and Trin comforted her. Osiler stood motionless looking skyward, his focus turned towards Ilo, or maybe Lastri, or possible it was Orthe. It was one of the three equine planets that were ever present in the sky. I think. What he pondered there, where his mind went then none knows. For minutes he stood in silence, and then he left the Clearing through the Siren's Hall without another word.</p>

      <p>The ceremony ended in a hushed cacophony. </p>

      <p>The unicorns dispersed. Ee and Artax, the young stallions exchangers impressed and surprised faces with each other. Ee was unabashedly smitten, having always been drawn to Aila's free spirit and independence. Artax was intrigued – Aila's wings were impressive and in their way, beautiful – but he felt uneasy. Being the largest in the herd apart from Osiler and Odon, he had always presumed that Aila would chose him to mate, if not a wish-stallion. Now, his immediate reaction was disappointment – he knew deep down that he had no desire to sire foals with wings! Ee on the other hand was enchanted, and Artax's thoughts comforted him. He realized the oddity of Aila's new form but it didn't diminish his esteem for her, it increased it.</p>

      <p>Eranor and Trin left the clearing last. Trin stayed close to Eranor's flank, comforting her. She was exhausted from the dream making and now she didn't know what to think. Her youngest daughter had always been a free spirit, but this was an unexpected event! Eranor had heard Aila's song many times over the past few moons – Why had she not wished for her stallion? And where had she gone! Why did she want to visit the realm of The Men? There were too many unanswered questions, and she was too exhausted to investigate further. She needed rest, and she needed the restorative energy Aila had been cultivating. She hoped she would see her soon as she made her way to her dwelling in the shade of her friend the Sycamore.</p>

      <p>As Eranor crested the hill on the last stretch of her walk home, she saw Aila's signature pink glow near the Sycamore. Eranor sighed a deep sigh, and felt a wash of relief. She may have sprouted wings and flown away but at least she remembered her dear mother. </p>

      <p>&quot;I think I'll leave you now&quot;, Trin said as they drew closer. &quot;I'm sure the two of you will have much to discuss and Trace will be glad for companionship this night.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Thank you, Trin, I've appreciated your companionship tonight myself.&quot;</p>

      
      <p className="section-title">The Reckoning</p>

      <p>&quot;Aila, you came!&quot; Eranor sent as she approached the tree and her beautiful pinkish shimmering daughter. Aila's coat was white of color, but her color was pink. Her horn, imbued with youth and ripe with magic, was constantly emitting a low level glow that clung to her form and wrapped her body in a subtle charming pink light. Her glow responded to her emotional state, and Aila was currently glowing with a dark, almost red, sheen. And her wings! Tucked in their resting position, Eranor hardly noticed them at first. Now she took a moment to gaze upon her daughter's new form. Even in the cover of night, she could distinguish the new shapes and the texture of feathers.</p>

      <p>&quot;Well aren't they just lovely. Come on, let me have a look.&quot; She demanded.</p>

      <p>&quot;Oh! You like them?&quot; Aila inquired as she slowly unfurled and rose her wingtips wide.</p>

      <p>&quot;I didn't say that.&quot; Eranor grinned. &quot;I think they're just incredible. I might not have chosen them for myself but you have.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Yes, mother, I have! And I don't know why and I don't know what to do. And I do love flying! But what have I done!?&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I don't know Aila, but it is done, and there is no going back. I'm sorry you are distressed.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I'm not distressed! I have wings!&quot; Aila cried. </p>

      <p>In all actuality, she was in fact distressed, she just didn't realize it yet. But she would soon.</p>

      <p>&quot;Yes, dear. You do. You have an infinite future in front of you to come to terms with that fact. But there's nothing that I can do about it right here and now.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I know...&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;But there is something that you can do for me.&quot; Eranor was extremely exhausted, and she lowered her head. &quot;I am quite tired.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Oh mother! I forgot your dream casting! You're so pale! Let me help you.&quot; </p>

      <p>Eranor stepped over to her clearing in the tall grass and slowly and carefully lay down. Aila followed, and when her mother was settled she leaned down and tucked her chin to point her horn towards her dam's chest. She slowly impaled her horn into her mother's side, aiming for the heart. When she could push no further, she closed her eyes and began expelling her energy into her mother's body. Where horn pierced hide there was a bright ring of bright pink, and where Aila's horn was exposed there was an incredible bright white that lit the eerie scene. </p>

      <p>It took a long time – Aila had been saving her magic for several weeks now – but eventually the process was complete. Aila withdrew her horn, and the glow diffused. Eranor was fast asleep, but her color had returned and she was breathing peacefully.</p>

      
      <p className="section-title">The Flight</p>

      <p>Aila grazed nearby until dawn – that mystical hour before the day had awoken. The grass here was good and substantial, but minty, and Aila had never particularly cared for mint. She grazed, and while restoring her mother's depleted magical energy had calmed her, she was still at odds with herself. Why on Earth had she made such an impetuous wish? Why, not even Liba had done anything this crazy, and everyone always said she was the impish one. Well, it appears she was the wild one now. Wings! What stallion would ever want a mare with <em>wings</em>!? What of her friends? Would they treat her differently now? No, what a silly question. <em>Of course they would.</em> This was distressing.</p>

      <p>&quot;I am distressed!&quot; Aila realized.</p>

      <p>She wanted desperately to talk to Liba, but it would be some time before that was a possibility, and Aila was agitated. Given her options, she decided to go for a fly. She reared up, spread her wings, and when she pushed them down her body went up. And she repeated the process. And it was actually quite easy to get the hang of, now that she knew what it was all about.</p>

      <p>Her first flight had been a bit of an emotional battle. At first it was terrifying, but she was so angry and confused that she didn't let it get to her. But now she had time for it to really sink in – horses were not meant to fly! Countering that was her experience. &quot;I have already done this, and it worked out fine, so surely it will be fine now&quot;, she thought as she watched the sycamore tree and mother below shrink smaller and smaller. </p>

      <p>As she rose higher and higher, she started moving forward, which she found almost as easy as thinking it. She just leaned into the direction she wanted to go and her wings did the rest. And then she had the thought to try <em>hopping</em>. Aila loved to hop and jump when she was land bound, so it was a natural instinct. But when she hopped in the air she flew in a dramatic arc hundreds of meters long. It was exhilarating! And so she air hopped for a while, and then she had another though. &quot;I wonder if I can <em>fly</em> super super super fast!?&quot; And she tried. And guess what.. ok I know you already guessed it. She could. She could fly super super super fast! And if you were here on the ground to see her flying by you would swear it was just a meteorite flying by – a great sharp pink line draw across the sky. </p>


      <p className="section-title">The Space Bath</p>

      <p>Aila's initial reservations about her wish had for the moment evaporated. She reveled in this new sensation. She rejoiced in her new command over her form through the atmosphere. She was elated – a feeling she was quite familiar with. When she tired of air hopping and air flying super super super fast (which she called shooting), she tried going as high as she could. She reached the limits of the atmosphere, and went higher still. She entered the blackness of space, and she kept flying, higher and higher towards Ilo, her favorite of the three equine planets. After several minutes of traversing the vast nothingness, she found her mind starting to wander. She thought about her mother, sleeping far below in the tall minty grass. She thought about Liba, and Liba's foal Ansil, and she felt a tinge of envy. Would she ever mate now that she was... this? Surely there was a stallion out there somewhere that would love her despite her... abnormality. Ee and Artax had both made their interests clear; perhaps one of them would still admire her? She did prefer Ee, though. But Artax was a simple sort and might not care that her foals might be winged, and he might be a fine partner in a pasture-dwelling sort of way. But Ee was a bit more mysterious and unpredictable; Aila had always been curious about him. Wow, her thoughts really were wandering out here among the stars.</p>

      <p>She tucked her wings in a moment, excited to feel the sudden drop of descent, but nothing happened. She floated there, with no resistance whatsoever. For some reason this made her laugh, though she didn't know why. </p>

      <p>She let herself drift above the sky until the cold ate away at her reserves of energy; for a long while her mind was blank, and she simply breathed in the light of the stars. When the sun crested the planet below, a tremendous light pummeled her body and consciousness. </p>

      <p>&quot;Well that was a bit of a rude awakening, wasn't it Mr. Sun!&quot; she exclaimed. </p>

      <p>She supposed she should make her way back to Naranthal. She had found a new calmness, and was looking forward to seeing Liba and Elsie and all her other friends. What would Squalmy say! </p>

      <p>When she looked down she felt a bit queasy. She could see the entire planet, like a great disk in the sky. She could places where the sun had yet to reach! It must be dawn – her favorite time of the not yet day – there where the sun was about to shine. </p>

      <p>As she looked down at the earth so far away, she felt suddenly afraid.</p>

      <p>&quot;Oh no!&quot; She thought. </p>

      <p>&quot;Where is my home?&quot; She wondered.</p>

      <p>From this height she didn't recognize any of the landscape. She should have kept better track of where she was going! </p>

      <p>With no other options, Aila flew down towards the line where sunlight met the darkness, and hoped she would be able to find her way once she was nearer the surface.</p>

      
      <p className="section-title">The Fountain of Youth</p>

      <p>She alighted near a small pond of sparkling clear blue water, in the warm sun of late morning, in a land completely foreign to her. She took several steps into the pond and had a long drink. The water was cool and had a tingly taste on her lips and tongue and at first she thought nothing of it as she had worked up a terrible thirst. But after a moment she paused, and she noticed in her reflection that her subtle pink ambient glow had intensified. There was something special about this water! She took another long drink, and felt her energies restoring. The tingly water was vaguely sweet, and though no longer thirsty she indulged in a third long dose. This was the most delicious pond she'd ever drank from!</p>

      <p>While lapping at the water greedily, she felt a pair of eyes on her from the trees near the edge of the pond across from her. The pond was only a dozen or so meters across, so when she glanced up she expected to see a friend or visitor, but there was no one. Unicorn eyes are quite good. They are much better than the great eagles at seeing long distances, and much better than the prosimians at seeing in the dark, and they are almost as powerful as the dragonflies at seeing in slow motion. When Aila saw nothing in the woods she did not assume that her eyes were deceiving her; she wondered what invisible presence she detected.</p>

      <p>&quot;Hello?&quot; She sent her curiosity out into the direction of the presence.</p>

      <p>She heard no reply, and the feeling of being watched subsided, so she bowed down to the water and began drinking again. As soon as she did so, she felt the presence return, and she quickly looked up a bit to the right, and as she did so, she saw a small branch of a magnolia tree move abruptly. She stared in that direction intently, her body perfectly still. Though she could see nothing but the woods there, she felt a life-force there that was almost familiar.</p>

      <p>&quot;Who are you, friend? You needn't hide from me. I am Aila, the winged unicorn, and I mean you no harm.&quot; Aila's curiosity got the better of her. </p>

      <p>There was a brief pause, but then Aila saw a very faint yellow glow – it wasn't so much a glow actually, it was more like a network of moving veins that had a faint yellow color – in the vague shape of an invisible unicorn.</p>

      <p>&quot;Oh Tabor! It's you! Thank Ilo, it's good to see you here! I have been lost for hours.&quot; She sent him her thoughts, but she was overflowing with energy. Each word was surrounded by a stream of powerful pink magic.</p>

      <p>Tabor's glow intensified momentarily, and Aila could almost see his complete form. He quickly moved his head in a direction away from the pond.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Do you want me to follow you?&quot; </p>

      <p>At that, Tabor turned away and trotted slowly away.</p>

      <p>It was not known to Aila that the blinded could make themselves visible to a unicorn, and it was unheard of that a blinded would lead an individual, but Aila loved and trusted her uncle, and he was after all the blinded – his purpose now was to lead the herd! </p>

      <p>&quot;I will follow!&quot; </p>

      <p>Aila flapped her wings gently for effect, and she skittered up and across the surface of the pool and was quickly close behind.</p>

      <p>He led her to the south; through a grove of blooming pink magnolia trees that caused Aila's heart to flutter; up a steep hillside completely overgrown with ivy and tall pine trees that dripped lichen; across a great terrain of tall grasses and shrubs where Aila lost sight of Tabor and for a long while followed a nearly invisible trail of stamped grass; and into a sunken vale of mysterious cypress trees. This was a protracted sojourn Tabor was leading her on. Aila had plenty of time to wonder where he was leading her, and why, which was the more intriguing though less answerable question. </p>

      <p>When they reached the cypress vale, Aila felt a slight familiarity. These were interesting trees, and she had long ago made friends with their striated boles that showed off their powerful root structures. Aila remembered them fondly from her adventures with Liba - there were many near the gates of the realms that they had visited.</p>

      <p>&quot;The gates!&quot; She cried, as she realized where they were.</p>

      <p>Tabor stopped a moment, and his yellow glow flared briefly before he continued onward.</p>

      <p>&quot;But why would you bring me here, Tabor?&quot; Perhaps this was just the most direct path to Naranthal. Surely Tabor was just helping her find her way home.</p>

      <p>They proceeded deeper into the vale, through a curvy trail, and were soon at the clearing where large standing stones marked the four directions around the grassy hill. Tabor led her not to the southern stone as she expected as she knew the gates were north of Naranthal, but in a direct path up the hill towards the gates.</p>

      <p>&quot;Tabor, where are you taking me?&quot; Aila demanded, though she knew he could not answer.</p>

      <p>This time he did not respond. His yellow glow was intensifying, and when they arrived at the ring of stone ground that encircled the swirling windows Aila could again clearly see his magical form of swirling yellow lines. He led her around to the easternmost side of the circular path, and stopped facing the portal to the west.</p>

      <p>Aila approached beside him, her mind abuzz. This was the gate to the realm of The Men.</p>

      <p>&quot;But Tabor, I don't understand. I have been here before, and I have even looked through this gate. But Oslier said it is forbidden! Why have you brought me here?&quot;</p>

      <p>He stood motionless, facing the gate. Aila could not read his thoughts and she was unnerved. She was used to fully understanding the thoughts and emotions of her friends and companions. She knew Tabor fairly well, and trusted him implicitly. Her mother, Eranor, had always been close with her older brother, and though Aila had not interacted with Tabor frequently of late, he was family. Long ago, for years after her naming, Tabor would still call her Joili, as a sort of tease, and Aila would lovingly rebuke him for that. Now, she wished desperately to hear his voice. Instead, the ghostly blind indication of him stood motionless staring into the portal of The Men. What did he want her to do? Should she look through? Should she <em>go</em> through? </p>

      <p>Why was this happening? The last day's cycle left Aila reeling. She had wished to go to the land of The Men, and been denied. She had wished for wings, and flown! She restored her mother's magical energy. She flew to the edge of the world and halfway to Ilo! And she had gotten lost, and then drank from a miraculous pond that saturated her with magic energy. She had found Tabor! That alone was a feat worth sharing with the herd - it was a revelation to her that it was even possible! And now she was being faced with an epic conundrum. What was she supposed to do?</p>

      <p>As if on cue, Tabor looked over at Aila and his eyes glowed thick with veins of magical yellow energy. He then took several paces backwards, bowed his head slightly downwards, and lurched forward spanning the gap between himself and the portal in a single bound before leaping up and towards the portal, where he vanished.</p>

      <p>&quot;Tabor!&quot; It was all she could exclaim before he was gone.</p>

      <p>Aila snorted, and pawed at the ground with her fore-hooves. It was clear that he wanted her to go through the portal. A large part of her wanted to! What was on the other side? Where would she find herself if she went? Would she finally meet The Men? Why was Tabor urging her here? <em>What did he know?</em> </p>

      <p>She was filled with excitement at the thought of adventuring out of her realm, and the magic bristled within her. The truth is, she wanted to go, she just wished she understood why this was happening. </p>

      <p>A thought came to her then. It was a saying that Tabor used long ago when Aila was young. One afternoon while walking with him and her mother, she had become afraid to leap across a wide stream, and he said to her ambivalently from the other side, <em>&quot;If not now, then maybe never!&quot;</em> It had peeved her at the time; she wasn't sure she would make it across, and she did not want to land in the rocky water. But she thought about never being able to do it and it gave her the courage she needed. Almost! She did land in the rocks and made a great splash, but she and Tabor and Eranor had a great laugh and it became one of her most cherished memories of her youth.</p>

      <p>She shuffled over to where Tabor had last stood, and gazed into the opalescent portal, and steeled herself.</p>

      <p>&quot;If not now, then maybe never,&quot; she said out loud to herself. With that, she spread her wings out wide and forward and leapt into the world of The Men.</p>


      <p className="section-title">III: The World of Men</p>

      <p className="section-title">The Mirror</p>

      <p>She landed where she least expected, which was exactly where she would have landed if she had jumped through nothing. She was in the middle of the 12 portals, on the stone pathway that led to the center of the circle. The only difference that caught her eye was that the tall black obelisk in the center of the structure was glowing with a quiet black light. The light faded momentarily. She approached the stone and placed her horn against the mirrored black surface, but felt nothing. She glanced around, not sure what she hoped to see. She had expected to be transported to the land of The Men, or to at least see visions of the Men as she had with Liba, but it seemed she had just leap through a non-magical gate.</p>

      <p>Aila turned to face the portal she had just come through. The stone pathway led directly to it from here, but there were diverging paths that led to either side of each of the gates. </p>

      <p>She sent out a large pulse of awareness, which informed her that she was in fact in the exact same place, give or take a few paces, as before she had jumped through the gate. What had happened? Were the gates broken? Did she not do it right? </p>

      <p>Curious. She stepped forward to inspect the portal she had come through, but as soon as she looked up she was startled by her reflection. What had been a swirl of indecipherable images and lights on the other side was from this vantage as smooth as a still pond in the morning. In the surface she saw her new incarnation for the first time. </p>

      <p>Aila had of course seen herself in reflective waters, and she had the awareness of her self as seen through her connections and sharing of thoughts with her friends and family of the herd. But this was the first time she had seen herself with her own eyes standing straight and tall. The mirror was true and the reflection perfect. She noticed her wings hangin loosely at her sides. One was nearly touching the ground! She adjusted them by pulling them back and tucking them in, and she admired the form they created. She looked like a swan! Curious, she spread her wings wide, and then directed them forward so that she could see the magnificence of the featherwork inside. She curled them forward and found that she could overlap them in front of herself so that just her eyes and horn were visible. She gave a brief flap and imagined what she would look like in flight, but found she didn't have to imagine – she was already several inches off the ground. </p>

      <p>This mirror was intriguing! She stepped close to the portal. Her horn was glowing hot pink, and tiny tendrils of magic vapor was drifting off her horn and face. Her eyes looked severe in a way she would not have expected, and as she cocked her head a few degrees to the side, the unicorn in the mirror did the opposite. She analyzed her feelings to try to coordinate herself to what she was seeing. She was admittedly a bit nervous and confused – what had she just done, and why wasn't the portal working? She opened her mouth and watched the mirror mimic her. She stuck out her tongue and flipped her ears forward and crossed her eyes, and the mirror copied it all. She looked absurd! Aila laughed, and the unicorn in the portal laughed and she saw that she looked a bit more relaxed. </p>

      <p>Oops – she noticed there was a bit of lichen on the top edge of her nose. She bent her head downward and lifted her right hoof up so that she could paw it off, but as she did so her horn connected with something hard and inert. The mirror! And then she remembered; Tabor had sealed the portal from the world of men.</p>

      <p>&quot;Oh no!&quot; </p>

      <p>&quot;What have I done?&quot; Had she in fact transported somewhere? Was <em>this</em> the world of Men? Was she trapped here for a hundred years? When had he sealed this gate?</p>

      <p>She stepped around the mirror, and examined the portal from the far side, the side she had initially leapt through. Instead of the swirling mass she had thought to see, there was nothing – just a thin, nearly invisible frame. The black obelisk was visible in the center of the hill. She walked through the frame and turned around to see the mirror once again, and she was at last convinced that she had indeed landed in a different realm.</p>

      
      <p className="section-title">The Hunt</p>

      <p>Aila turned and exited the inner circle via the path near the mirror and circumnavigated the portals. Each of the other eleven gates matched the first. They were all empty frames. She wondered what she was meant to do. Why on earth had Tabor lead her here? Had she in fact ever even seen him, or was that just an illusion brought on by the magic pond water she had drank? She still felt abuzz with the energy she had consumed there, but she noticed her stomach was grumbling. Unicorns had to eat! </p>

      <p>With nowhere else in mind, she decided to had south towards Naranthal and her home pastures. As she trotted down the path through the giant cypress trees, she noticed that everything looked the same, but something felt remarkably different. She couldn't tell what unnerved her, but she was on high alert and keenly aware of her surrounds. She sent out pulses numerous times, but it was indeed the landscape she was familiar with. Something was wrong, she knew; it was almost as if something was missing. Ah, it was the animals. Or, rather, the absence of them. She couldn't sense any other being anywhere nearby.</p>

      <p>She passed through the Cypress, and out through the trails that were cut into the low tangle of brambles and rhododendrons that demarcated the transition from forest to plain. She had only traversed this trail on a couple occasions but she recognized nearly every step. Soon she came to a small shaded thicket rich with ivy and tall willow trees. There she stopped abruptly. Her keen hearing and smell forewarned her of the arrival of her friends the rabbit and the fox as they ran through the underbrush. So there were animals here after all!</p>

      <p>As they scurried through the brush and onto the trail, Aila called out, &quot;Hello Bisky, Tiffle! Where are you off to in such a hurry?&quot; </p>

      <p>Before she had finished her greeting, the rabbit, upon rounding the bend, halted in his tracks for a fraction of a second and darted off into the brambles. Aila saw that a tuft of hair was left dangling from a particularly nasty looking thorn near the ground. In a breath, the fox crashed through the mesh of brambles after the rabbit, and Aila stood open-mouthed. She was awash in the wake of uncomfortable feelings. This was no game they were playing! </p>

      <p>Concerned, Aila circled back around the thickest of the the bushes to a spot that was clear enough for her to sneak through into the network of blackberries and tall gangly plants, and she cantered over to where she saw Tiffle the red fox at rest. She felt a terrible nausea hit her then, and shook her head from left to right, trying to shake it off.</p>

      <p>&quot;Tiffle! What are you doing?&quot; She thought out loud to the fox as she approached.</p>

      <p>The fox turned to her – something dangled loosely from his mouth – and immediately sprang away and disappeared into the deep forest before Aila could get close.</p>

      <p>'What is this? What is happening!', she thought. 'Is Tiffle afraid of <em>me</em>? Whatever for?'</p>

      <p>She walked forward and was stunned to see the rabbits torn body, in pieces on the ground, lifeless.</p>

      <p>&quot;Oh Bisky, you poor animal! What has he done to you?&quot;</p>

      <p>She examined the rabbit with her horn, but parts were missing, and he was beyond restoration. The hungry fox had killed the wild hare.</p>

      <p>Aila felt sick. She impulsively spread her wings and flew several meters into the air, cresting the tree line, seeking vainly to evade her own thoughts. What was wrong with that animal that could make it do something like that? She had never seen an intentional felling before! It made no sense to her. She wished she could go back and stop the atrocity before it happened, but there was nothing she could do about it. </p>

      <p>Instead she breathed, and she focused on the sensation of the wind in her wingtips. She instinctively sent out a pulse and turned in the air for Naranthal, her home. She didn't know what else to do.</p>

      
      <p  className="section-title">The Wagon</p>

      <p>Aila's emotional state stabilized rapidly. Flying was still a new activity for her and it consumed much of her attention. She stayed low in the sky, barely above the treetops and focused on trying to remain as steady as possible. She found that the more she focused on her task the less successful she became, but when she concentrated on the direction she was going, her wings and body stabilized. As she progressed, she found that when she focused on her empty belly, or the delicious golden fields of Naranthal, her flying was at its best.</p>

      <p>When the trees dwindled down to a smattering and the grasses of Elseland began in Ernest, she landed for a quick bite. This was not favored pastureland of her herd, as the tall grasses here grey bitter and woody with sharp edges, but she was hungry, and she could of course eat and walk. </p>

      <p>Hours had passed since her encounter with the fox and rabbit, and though it was unlike her to dwell, she kept remembering the look that fox had given her before he disappeared. It was as though he knew what he had done was wrong, but he simultaneously enjoyed it. Maybe she was reading too much into the look in his eyes, but it haunted her. A part of poor Bisky dangling from his mouth... he had been <em>eating</em> him. Why would he do that? He must have been starving. That would explain the pleasure in his eyes. Aila herself was currently feeding her empty stomach. But there was plenty of food here, so that didn't make much sense. </p>

      <p>She stumbled upon a patch of lush green clover and chomped at it a while, and she was grateful for the switch from the tall grass which she found barely palatable. Tabor came to mind again, and she reminded herself of her morning. Things were clearly different now, and she <em>had</em> come through the gate. Now she couldn't sense the life-forces of the local fauna, and to top it off they ate each other. If this was indeed the world of The Men, she wasn't so sure she liked it all that much. Again, she wondered, &quot;Why did Tabor urge me here? Why did I want to come here? And if this <em>is</em> the realm of The Men, where are they to be found?&quot;</p>

      <p>The answer to that last question soon presented itself. Aila had moved on from the clover and was considering making a super fast dash for Naranthal when she heard a commotion from far away to the south west. A squeaky high pitched sound. A clunking sound and an accompanying rattle. The rhythmic footfalls of unicorns! Her ears perked up and she tuned her eyes on the direction of the sound. It was coming nearer. </p>

      
      <p  className="section-title">The Men</p>

      <p>It was late morning, and Ian and Cal were weary from loading the wagon. They were cultivating a state of bored resentment over the entire nature of their trip. The young brothers would much rather be anywhere else than en route to Hillsdale with the tailor's bolts of fabric and the precious box of leather working tools and supplies. </p>

      <p>Ian was particularly resentful. They'd lived as peasants in the grove for what seemed like a century. Instead of his wish for something exciting to happen (anything!) coming true, or any of his family even remembering that it was his birthday, he got the grunt work dumped on his shoulders, again. It was bad enough having to field errands for his father, but it was his box of leather tool that had been sold. He'd spent months crafting those awls and burnishers, and he had just started cutting the teardrop shaped pieces for a scaled cuirass he'd been making for himself. It had taken almost a year of working in the tanner's shop just to afford the leather and now he would have no way to work it. He would make new tools, but the setback was dispiriting. He wished that his older brother Cal had never said anything about the tools to their father but knew that in his way he was trying to be helpful. Their youngest sister Anna was sick and needed expensive herbs.</p>

      <p>Cal was whistling off key, and that bothered Ian not at all for he was deaf. The brothers walked together on one side of the rickety wagon. The floppily rotating wooden wheels squeaked and whined, which also bothered Ian none.</p>

      <p>At least the rain had stopped. It was a lovely morning, and the sun had already risen above the trees and there was still a bit of peach left in the sky to the east. A family of swifts raced in a zig-zag across the tall green grass fields where the shining white unicorn grazed. </p>

      <p>Wait, what! Ian stared for a long moment, not trusting his eyes. He slapped his hand to his brother's shoulder and pointed. Cal stared in disbelief for a long moment, not trusting his eyes. </p>

      <p>Cal pulled back on the reins and stopped the wagon. He took a step towards the unicorn but Ian put his hand to his chest and made that face that meant he was serious. </p>

      <p>The unicorn was walking towards them. She had seen them, and now she was walking towards them. And she had wings. </p>

      
      <p className="section-title">The Winged Unicorn</p>

      <p>As they came into view Aila realized they were not unicorns, but horses coming her way. They had a heavy looking cart attached to them with ropes and two slender stick like creatures walked beside. They wore brown flappy material on their bodies, and one was making a peculiar sound with his face. These must be The Men! </p>

      <p>She ambled towards them and then they stopped and became quiet. Were they afraid of her as well? She was curious, and proceeded to approach them slowly and quietly. She herself was not afraid. She didn't see any long knives or other objects.</p>

      <p>As stopped as she neared, and welcomed them with a gently half-snort, half-neigh.</p>

      <p>&quot;Hello, friends. Are you The Men?&quot; She was about two paces away, and she spoke softly. &quot;Horse friends, tell me, do you consent to this treatment of your own free will? These ropes, do you not find them uncomfortable?&quot;</p>

      <p>There was no reply. The horses stood motionless and vacant. One of the Men made a motion to the other, and then slowly stepped towards aila. He held something out at her - it was a small red object. An apple! She liked apples! There weren't apple trees anywhere near here that she knew of, and she wondered how this creature had come upon one. </p>

      <p>The Men then did something startling. He threw the apple at the ground by her feet. She impulsively huffed and stepped backwards, but the Men stood motionless. One of the Men made soft, indecipherable noises that were unnerving. She deduced that the Men were gifting her the apple in a sign of friendship. That was ok, she supposed, though she was unnerved by the strangeness of the entire scene, and the horses strange behavior did not put her at ease. </p>

      <p>She stepped forward and took the apple in her mouth, keeping her eyes on the Men. She crunched down, and a piece fell to the ground while she worked the sweet juices into her mouth. She loved apples! As she bent to retrieve the piece that had escaped, she noticed one of the Men was coming nearer, his limb extended towards her. He seemed slow and harmless enough. What did he want? She wished he would speak.</p>

      <p>&quot;What do you want? Why do you not speak?&quot;</p>

      <p>He came quite close to her, ignoring her inquiry. At a few feet away she felt a faint sense of adoration. The Men did have a feeling, it was just very slight! His outstretched limb then touched the top of her nose. She imagined this must be how the Men greeted each other. Strange, but she supposed that for a species that can't talk, unexpected customs must arise. </p>

      <p>Then the Men moved his hand up and down on her nose, and Aila found that peculiar, but she enjoyed the sensation. It was oddly comforting, and she noticed a tickle arose and then was soothed by his touch. She shut her eyes and sent him a bit of her energy as gratitude. Her horn pulsed a gentle pink light, which was all but invisible in the sunlight.</p>

      <p>The other men had slowly approached, and the spell was broken when he threw a rope across Aila's neck.</p>

      <p>&quot;No! What are you doing?&quot; She cried.</p>

      <p>The other men made an almost identical sound.</p>

      <p>The men pulled down on his rope, and somehow it constricted around her neck in a most uncomfortable and frightening way. So she dispelled it, and the rope vanished. She reared up on her hind legs and the Men with the rope fell backwards to the ground.</p>

      <p>&quot;You will not capture me, small Men! How dare you try! I am Aila, the Winged Unicorn! I am here by my own will. I am free!&quot;</p>

      <p>As she spread her wings and took flight she noticed the other Men, the one whom she had let touch her, standing towards her with his top limbs outstretched. Perhaps not all of The Men were the same. No matter. She wanted nothing to do with these two now. </p>

      <p>She rose into the air and made her way towards Naranthal.</p>


      <p className="section-title">The Castle</p>

      <p>She rose to a great height with only a few wingstrokes. She was furious! And a little bit scared. She remembered back to the story of Marissella's sad fate, and it had begun in much the same way, with The Men trying to capture a unicorn with a rope. Until today she hadn't even really known what rope was. She had heard of it from stories of the Men, but she had never seen it before, and she surely had never felt it. Around her neck, no less. The gall! Her outrage mounted. Aila liked most things she had encountered, but she didn't think she liked rope, much. </p>

      <p>Her feelings about Men were more complicated. She certainly did not like the one that had put a rope around her neck. In her mind she saw him falling back to the ground as the rope vanished from his hands, and as she played back the event she felt an urge to put her foot down on his body and stomp him out of existence. What a dreadful thought! What a vicious aspect this realm was bringing out in her. She had never had such thoughts before and she disliked how they made her feel. She blew the tension out through her nose as snort and resolved to think kinder thoughts. </p>

      <p>One of the Men had given her an apple and rubbed her nose. She had felt that he admired her. He seemed calm and gentle. Perhaps even kind? </p>

      <p>Her anger cooled off as she considered this. It was strange to her that the two Men had behaved so differently. It actually fascinated her. It reminded her of the time she had looked through the portal with Liba, when she had seen so many fractured moments of these creatures; some of the things she saw distressed her, but some of them she almost envied. </p>

      <p>If men varied so much amongst each other, how could she ever know who was safe and who was to be feared? Perhaps the gentle one was just craftier and also had foul motives. Perhaps he wanted to capture her as well. Aila didn't believe that, because she trusted the warm feeling that she felt from him. The other Men had no feeling about him at all, and he gave her no such comfort. Perhaps only some men were treacherous. Still, that made them all treacherous. She would apparently have to be more careful if she was to get home in one piece.</p>

      <p>Home! How was she supposed to get home? She had come through a portal to the land of The Men and now she was stuck here! Tabor had sealed the portal, and she had no idea how else to get back to her own realm. She still hadn't spoken to Liba or Elsie or any of her friends in the herd and she missed them. She may have made a terrible mistake coming here, where animals kill each other and Men try to capture her. Her thoughts boiled again. 'What a terrible place this is turning out to be. Why why why on earth did Tabor lead me here?'</p>

      <p>She took a few vigorous wing flaps, and surveyed the ground below. She saw the trail that the Men and the strange horses and wagon had been on, winding south towards – she could see from her vantage that something peculiar where the fields of Naranthal should be. She followed the road back with her eyes and saw now that alongside it were several large brown disruptions with rigid sides. She knew that the Men built things out of dead trees – perhaps these were their dwellings. But there were so many of them! </p>

      <p>She took several more vigorous wing flaps. Soon she was near the hill where her mother's favorite Sycamore grew. Aila breathed a sigh of relief to see it standing tall and wide as ever, but there was one of the brown structures situated close by. This was the closest she had been to one, and she saw that it was in fact made of dead trees and mud and straw. It was big enough that three or four unicorns could fit inside at one time, and it had a gate cut into one side. Peculiar indeed!</p>

      <p>She stayed high above the ground, and as she continued south she realized that the brown structures were tiny compared to what occupied the fields she sought. The lush pastures were nowhere to be seen. They were instead covered entirely with stone and tree parts and mud and straw and Men. There were hundreds of them, milling about on paved paths and making such loud noises that Aila could hear them from the clouds. But what intrigued and impressed her most was the enormous stone structure that sat in the middle of the entire conglomeration. It was hundreds of meters wide in both directions, and nearly as tall. There were four great towers on each corner, and long colorful banners atop conical structures on each. It was remarkable, and Aila was amazed.</p>

      <p>She flew closer to the incredible structure, and as she did, something atop the nearest tower attracted her eye. It was a Men, and yet it appeared very different that those she had recently encountered. This one was slender and not quite as tall. It wore a white garment that stretched out behind her for many meters. It was narrow atop but billowed out near the ground, and Aila thought it looked like a flower. Also, this one was unfortunate because it was leaking profusely from its mid-section down the edge of the structure.</p>

      <p>Aila's curiosity got the best of her she realized when the Men on the top of the structure looked up at her and made eye contact. She should not have been flying this close! The Men's eyes went wide, and their mouth fell open. Aila did not want to appear rude, so she flew in a narrow ring and landed gently on the stone surface several meters from the Men. </p>

      <p>&quot;Hello, Sierra, what ails you?&quot; Aila greeted.</p>

      <p>The Men just stared at her, their mouth agape. They seemed terrified.</p>

      <p>&quot;You needn't fear <em>me</em>, fair one. I am Aila, and I mean you no harm. Perhaps we may be friends!&quot; Aila tried to use her most soothing voice. She was of course wary of Men after her last encounter, but this one seemed frail and sad and unthreatening. Aila certainly did not want to frighten the poor thing.</p>

      <p>&quot;...Friends?&quot; The men questioned meekly after a perfectly timed dramatic pause. Princesses were good at such things, though Aila did not yet know that's what she had stumbled upon.</p>

      <p>&quot;Friends, sure.&quot; Aila replied. </p>

      <p>&quot;You have wings. You can fly?&quot; </p>

      <p>&quot;Yes, clearly.&quot; She fluffed her wings out slightly, for effect. Unicorns have their own talents as you well know.</p>

      <p>&quot;How is that possible? How are <em>you</em> possible? Am I dead? Did I finally do it? Did I jump to my death?&quot; </p>

      <p>Aila noticed the young Men's eyes were red and wet. They'd been crying. Their skin was fair and thin and almost transparent in places. They had dark auburn hair that was pulled into a loose knot behind their face. They stood on the edge of the stone ground, near a break in the short wall that was apparently meant to keep the Men from falling off. Globs of ethereal black fluid was slowly draining from their chest, pulsing out with each heartbeat. And an aura of intense sadness spread from their body.</p>

      <p>&quot;I came through the gate. In my realm, this structure stands in the middle of a great plain of golden grass, Naranthal, my home. I do not know how I am possible, but I wished for my wings at my wishing ceremony and I assure you that you are not dead. But dear Sierra, you are leaking, and this we must address.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;What? How do you know me? Who are you?&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I don't know you, we just met. I am Aila, the Winged Unicorn. I am from Naranthal, of the Elseland herd. I would take you there today if I could but I myself am trapped here. The portal is sealed. But Sierra, you are leaking and appear to be critically wounded. I can help if you'll let me.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;How do you know my name? What do you mean I'm leaking? Do you mean my eyes? I was crying, I can't hide that I suppose.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I don't know your name, I just call you what I think you should be called. Not your eyes, your chest.&quot; Aila stepped forward, and pointer her horn towards the princess. </p>

      <p>&quot;Here.&quot; </p>

      <p>Aila increased the magical current to her horn, and in the magical pink light that flared up, the princess could see. She <em>was</em> leaking! The hole she had felt in her chest was real, and dark blackish red fluid had flooded the front of her and drenched her gown and a puddle had even formed at her feet. With each heartbeat a new spurt of the dark goop was expelled. She was mortified, and she gasped a slight shriek of shock. </p>

      <p>&quot;Help!&quot; The princess cried, waving her hands about herself.</p>

      <p>&quot;I will.&quot;</p>

      <p>Aila put her horn to the princesses chest, and into the gaping hole. A swirl of various colors twisted inside her horn, and after a moment it grew brighter and brighter. The princess shrieked. The unicorn closed her eyes. A final bright flash of light articulated the event. New flesh materialized and sealed the wound. Aila's horn was left embedded a few centimeters into the area over the princess's heart. She pulled her head back, and when the horn vacated the skin, a slight pink seven pointed star-shaped scar about the size of the princess's pinky nail remained.</p>

      <p>&quot;I am sorry, I did not know that Men scar.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Men? I am not a man, Unicorn, I am a princess. A woman.&quot;</p>

      <p>Aila cocked her head. Of course! This was must be a female Men. That explained her different appearance. Her delicate features, slightness of body, her long tresses. Perhaps even her strange but beautiful clothing. </p>

      <p>&quot;My apologies, princess.&quot; Aila was embarrassed and felt that she had insulted the woman. &quot;I know very little of The Men.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Again, The Men? Why do you call me that?&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;I am sorry! What should we call you? In our history we have met The Men, but none of them has spoken to us but the little ones, and they did not tell us much. I did not expect that any of you could talk.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Well, I suppose you should call us Humans, or People. I don't much care for either name, but that is what people call us. Men are the males of our species, and women the females. I am a person. When you say 'the little ones', do you mean children?&quot; </p>

      <p>&quot;I suppose so; I never actually met any 'people' before this day.&quot; </p>

      <p>&quot;Then we're even, for I have never met a unicorn.&quot; Sierra held her hands gently over her breast. She looked down at herself, and then back at Aila, the unicorn standing before her.</p>

      <p>In a quieter but more serious voice she asked, &quot;Aila, what have you done to me?&quot;</p>

      <p>The unicorn lowered here head so that her eyes were level with the princess's. &quot;I closed the hole. All of your love and energy was pouring out of you and you were dying. I am sorry about the scar, princess, though it may have been unavoidable. All love scars. Did someone hurt you?&quot;</p>

      <p>The princess looked down at her chest again. She felt different. She had been mourning for weeks, and had lost herself to her anguish and unrequited longing. She tried not to think about it, but it was everywhere. She constantly ached for him, and yet she could not see him, nor tell him how she loved him. She had felt drained of meaning, and her every ambition abandoned her. She spent days on end at the tower crenelations considering her fate. Life had no meaning, and she had no will to go on. It was her fear of dying that kept her alive, for whenever she put her toes to the edge, a wave of vertigo and fear overrode her decision to end herself. </p>

      <p>&quot;Henry.&quot; She whispered the name out loud. &quot;He was to marry me. I love him with all of my heart, but he did not love me. I only believed that he did. Perhaps I just wished it. He made me feel so alive, Aila. He brought me so much joy. And now I have no one. Even my father has gone away.&quot;</p>

      <p>Sierra had stopped talking weeks ago, as her sickness consumed her. She had sequestered herself in her tower, and only her quiet maid of honour, Bee, had seen her in these dark days. She brought food and spirits, herbs and flowers. She lit candles, and placed peppermint in various places throughout the princess's chambers. She made the bed, and took care of the menial chores for Sierra, but there was little else to do and little to say. </p>

      <p>&quot;He <em>made you</em> feel these things?&quot; Aila inquired in disbelief. &quot;Perhaps this is a human thing? Men can <em>make</em> you feel things? Unicorns feel our own feelings. We are aware of other's feelings, and those can change what we decide to feel. But none can make us feel a thing. None can make us feel love or joy, or even fear; those feelings come from our own making. Our feelings belong to us, and in fact they are us – they make us who we are. I don't mean to preach, Sierra, but this is the way with us. When we love, we give our energy to another, and they give us theirs. It feels wonderful because their love is a feeling custom made for us. Trading energy feels good! I think you have been giving your love away for a long time without getting any back.&quot;</p>

      <p>The princess looked out at the mountains in the distance, and down at the ground for a brief moment, then she looked again at the unicorn before her.</p>

      <p>&quot;I still don't believe that you are real. May I touch you? You are such a beautiful creature.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;You may.&quot; Aila was slightly alarmed, but she felt nothing but meekness from Sierra, and she again dismissed her apprehension.</p>

      <p>She stepped closer to the princess and rose her head slightly. The princess reached up and very delicately placed her hand on the unicorn's neck. Aila could barely feel the touch, but she felt a tiny gentle loving sensation from the princess. She returned it with a soft pulse of magical energy, which she focused to Sierra's heart. </p>

      <p>&quot;You have much love in you. I believe you are going to be fine.&quot; Aila gently sent her words of affirmation, and Sierra responded.</p>

      <p>&quot;You know, Aila, I think I will be.&quot;</p>
